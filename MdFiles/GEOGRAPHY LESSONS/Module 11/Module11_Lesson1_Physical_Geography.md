## If YOU lived there...
You live on the coast of Brazil, near the mouth of the Amazon River. Now you are taking your first trip up the river deep into the rain forest. The river is amazingly wide and calm. Trees on the riverbanks seem to soar to the sky. Your boat slows as you pass a small village. You notice that all the houses rest on poles that lift them eight to ten feet out of the water.

**What would it be like to live in the rain forest?**

## Caribbean South America

Look at the map of Caribbean South America on the next page. As you can see, this region features rugged mountains, highlands, and plains drained by huge river systems. Caribbean South America also has one of the world's highest concentrations of plant and animal species.

### Physical Features

The highest point in the region is in Colombia, a country larger than California and Texas combined. On the western side of Colombia, the **Andes** mountains reach 18,000 feet (5,490 m). The Andes form a **cordillera**, a mountain system made up of roughly parallel ranges. Some of the Andes' snowcapped peaks are active volcanoes. Eruptions and earthquakes shake these mountains frequently.

East of the Andes, the land slopes down to the **Llanos** (YAH-nohs), vast plains that stretch across Colombia and Venezuela. The Llanos are drained by the **Orinoco River**, which flows east to the Atlantic Ocean. During the rainy season, the Llanos flood easily. During the dry season, the plains become parched.

The Guiana Highlands are a mountainous region in the eastern part of Caribbean South America. They extend through Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. For millions of years, wind and rain have eroded these mountains, creating unusual rock formations and spectacular waterfalls. Angel Falls in Venezuela is the world's highest waterfall, with a drop of 3,212 feet (979 m).

### Climate and Vegetation

Caribbean South America's location near the equator gives it a tropical climate with high temperatures year-round. However, elevation affects temperature, so higher areas are cooler than lower areas. The region also has distinct wet and dry seasons.

The lowlands of Caribbean South America are covered with tropical rain forests and tropical grasslands. The rain forests are home to an incredible variety of plant and animal species. Scientists estimate that a single acre of rain forest may contain more than 100 different tree species.

The Llanos are covered with grasses and scattered trees. During the rainy season, these plains become wetlands that support a variety of wildlife, including capybaras (the world's largest rodents), caimans (relatives of alligators), and many bird species.

In the mountains, vegetation changes with elevation. The lower slopes are covered with forests, while higher elevations have alpine meadows and, at the highest elevations, permanent snow and ice.

## Atlantic South America

Atlantic South America includes Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. This region is dominated by the Amazon Basin, a vast area drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries.

### Physical Features

The **Amazon River** is the world's second-longest river (after the Nile) and carries more water than any other river in the world. It begins in the Andes mountains of Peru and flows east across Brazil to the Atlantic Ocean. At its mouth, the Amazon is so wide that from the middle of the river, you cannot see either shore.

The Amazon Basin is a low-lying region that covers much of northern Brazil and parts of neighboring countries. It is covered with the world's largest tropical rain forest, the Amazon rain forest. This forest is home to an incredible diversity of plant and animal species, many of which have not yet been identified by scientists.

South of the Amazon Basin, the land rises to the Brazilian Highlands, a region of plateaus and low mountain ranges. The Brazilian Highlands cover much of eastern and southern Brazil. They are not as high as the Andes, but they form a significant barrier between the coast and the interior of the continent.

In the south, the Paraná River and the Uruguay River join to form the **Río de la Plata** (River of Silver), which flows into the Atlantic Ocean between Argentina and Uruguay. The Río de la Plata is actually an **estuary**, a body of water where fresh water from rivers mixes with salt water from the ocean.

The **Pampas** are vast, fertile plains that stretch across parts of Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil. These plains are covered with grasses and have some of the most productive agricultural land in South America.

### Climate and Vegetation

Atlantic South America has a variety of climates due to its large size and range of elevations. The Amazon Basin has a tropical climate with high temperatures and abundant rainfall year-round. This climate supports the lush vegetation of the Amazon rain forest.

The Brazilian Highlands have a more moderate climate, with cooler temperatures due to their higher elevation. The region receives less rainfall than the Amazon Basin, and the vegetation transitions from forests to savannas (grasslands with scattered trees).

The Pampas have a temperate climate with distinct seasons. Winters are mild, and summers are warm. The natural vegetation of the Pampas is grassland, but much of the region has been converted to agricultural use.

### Natural Resources

Atlantic South America is rich in natural resources. The Amazon rain forest is often called the "lungs of the Earth" because its trees produce a significant amount of the world's oxygen. The forest also contains valuable hardwoods, medicinal plants, and a vast array of plant and animal species that are important for biodiversity.

The region also has significant mineral resources, including iron ore, bauxite (used to make aluminum), manganese, and gold. Brazil is one of the world's leading producers of iron ore.

The fertile soils of the Pampas support extensive agriculture, particularly cattle ranching and the cultivation of crops such as wheat, corn, and soybeans.

## Pacific South America

Pacific South America includes Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. This region is dominated by the Andes mountains, which run along the western edge of the continent.

### Physical Features

The Andes mountains form a continuous chain along the western edge of South America, stretching from Venezuela in the north to the southern tip of Chile. In Pacific South America, the Andes are at their widest and highest. The mountain range includes many peaks over 20,000 feet (6,100 m) high, including Aconcagua in Argentina, which at 22,834 feet (6,960 m) is the highest point in the Western Hemisphere.

The Andes in this region consist of two main ranges with a high plateau, called the Altiplano, between them. The Altiplano is home to Lake Titicaca, the highest navigable lake in the world, located on the border between Peru and Bolivia.

Between the Andes and the Pacific Ocean lies a narrow coastal plain. In Peru and northern Chile, this plain is extremely dry, containing the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth. Some parts of the Atacama receive less than 0.04 inches (1 mm) of rain per year.

### Climate and Vegetation

The climate in Pacific South America varies greatly with elevation and latitude. The Andes create several distinct climate zones:

1. The coastal zone has a desert climate in Peru and northern Chile, with very little rainfall. Further south, the climate becomes more temperate with increasing rainfall.

2. The western slopes of the Andes receive more rainfall than the eastern slopes, supporting cloud forests at certain elevations.

3. The Altiplano has a cold, dry climate with large daily temperature variations.

4. The eastern slopes of the Andes transition from alpine environments to tropical forests as elevation decreases.

5. In southern Chile, the climate is cool and rainy, supporting temperate rainforests.

The Pacific coast of South America is affected by **El Niño**, a periodic warming of the ocean waters that can cause significant changes in weather patterns. During El Niño years, the normally dry coastal regions may receive heavy rainfall, leading to flooding and landslides. El Niño also affects marine life, causing fish populations to decline or move to different areas.

### Natural Resources

Pacific South America is rich in mineral resources. The Andes mountains contain deposits of copper, silver, gold, zinc, tin, and other minerals. Chile is the world's largest producer of copper, and Peru is a major producer of silver, copper, and gold. Bolivia has significant deposits of tin and silver.

The coastal waters of Peru and Chile are normally rich in fish due to the Humboldt Current, which brings cold, nutrient-rich water from the Antarctic. This supports one of the world's most productive fishing industries, although fish populations can decline dramatically during El Niño events.

Although the countries of Pacific South America have many valuable resources, one resource they do not have much of is good farmland. Many people farm, but the region's mostly cool, arid lands make it difficult to produce large amounts of crops for export.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned that the physical geography of Caribbean South America includes mountains, highlands, plains, and rivers. Physical features of Atlantic South America include great river systems and plains. A huge part of the region is the Amazon rain forest. Finally, you learned that the Andes mountains are the main physical feature of Pacific South America.
