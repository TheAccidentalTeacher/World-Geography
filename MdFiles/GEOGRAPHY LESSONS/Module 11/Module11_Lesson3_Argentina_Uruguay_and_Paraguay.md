## If YOU lived there...
You live in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. On weekends you like to visit the old part of the city and admire its beautiful buildings. You also enjoy walking along the banks of the Río de la Plata and watching fishers bring in their catch. Sometimes you visit the parks and beaches along the banks of the river.

## Argentina's History and Culture

Like most of South America, Argentina was originally home to groups of Indians. Groups living on the Pampas hunted wild game, while farther north Indians built irrigation systems for farming. However, unlike most of South America, Argentina has very few native peoples remaining. Instead, Argentina's culture has been mostly influenced by Europeans.

### Early History

The first Europeans to come to Argentina were the Spanish. In the 1500s Spanish conquerors spread from the northern part of the continent into southern South America in search of silver and gold. They named the region Argentina. Argentina means "land of silver" or "silvery one."

The Spanish soon built settlements in Argentina. The Spanish monarch granted land to the colonists, who in turn built the settlements. These landowners were also given the right to force the Indians living there to work.

During the colonial era, the Pampas became an important ranching area. The **gauchos** (GOW-chohs), or cowboys, who worked on these ranches became symbols of Argentina. The gauchos were known for their horsemanship, bravery, and independent spirit. They developed their own distinctive culture, with unique clothing, music, and traditions.

Argentina declared independence from Spain in 1816. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, millions of European immigrants came to Argentina, primarily from Italy and Spain. These immigrants had a profound impact on Argentine culture, influencing everything from the language (which includes many Italian words) to the cuisine (which features Italian dishes like pizza and pasta).

### People and Culture

Today, Argentina has a population of about 45 million people. Unlike many other Latin American countries, where mestizos (people of mixed European and Indian ancestry) make up a significant portion of the population, mestizos make up only about 3 percent of the population. Most Argentines are of European descent, primarily Italian and Spanish.

The vast majority of Argentines are Roman Catholic, reflecting the country's Spanish colonial heritage. However, Argentina also has the largest Jewish population in Latin America, as well as significant Protestant and Muslim minorities.

Spanish is the official language of Argentina, but the Argentine dialect has distinctive features, including a unique pronunciation and vocabulary influenced by Italian.

Argentine culture is a blend of European and native traditions. The tango, Argentina's most famous cultural export, originated in the working-class neighborhoods of Buenos Aires in the late 19th century. This passionate dance and its accompanying music have become symbols of Argentine identity.

Argentine cuisine reflects the country's European heritage and its tradition of cattle ranching. Beef is a staple of the Argentine diet, and asado (barbecue) is a popular way of preparing it. Mate, a caffeine-rich herbal tea, is Argentina's national drink and is often shared among friends as a social ritual.

## Argentina Today

Argentina is the second-largest country in South America (after Brazil) and the eighth-largest country in the world. It stretches from the subtropical north to the subantarctic south, encompassing a wide range of landscapes and climates.

### Buenos Aires

**Buenos Aires**, Argentina's capital and largest city, is often called the "Paris of South America" because of its European-style architecture and cosmopolitan culture. The city is home to about 3 million people, with a metropolitan area of around 15 million.

Buenos Aires is Argentina's political, economic, and cultural center. It is home to the national government, the country's major financial institutions, and its most prestigious universities and cultural institutions. The city has a vibrant arts scene, with numerous theaters, museums, and galleries.

Despite its wealth and sophistication, Buenos Aires, like many large cities, has areas of poverty. Some poor residents live in villas miserias, or shantytowns, on the outskirts of the city.

### Economy

Argentina has a diverse economy based on agriculture, industry, and services. The country is a major producer and exporter of agricultural products, particularly beef, wheat, corn, and soybeans. The fertile Pampas region is the heart of Argentina's agricultural production.

Argentina also has significant industrial development, including food processing, automobile manufacturing, and textiles. The country has substantial natural resources, including oil, natural gas, and minerals.

Despite its natural wealth, Argentina has experienced economic instability throughout its history. The country has gone through periods of high inflation, currency devaluation, and debt crises. In 2001, Argentina experienced a severe economic crisis that led to social unrest and political instability.

Argentina is a member of **Mercosur**, a regional trade agreement that also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Mercosur aims to promote free trade and the movement of goods, people, and currency among its member countries.

Like many developing countries, Argentina has a significant **informal economy**, which includes economic activities that are not officially registered or taxed. The informal economy provides jobs and income for many Argentines, but it also means that the government loses potential tax revenue.

## Uruguay

Uruguay is a small country located between Argentina and Brazil. It is the second-smallest country in South America (after Suriname). Despite its small size, Uruguay has a distinct identity and culture.

### History and People

Uruguay was originally inhabited by the Charrúa Indians. The Spanish established a colony in the region in the early 18th century, but the area was contested between Spain and Portugal for many years. Uruguay finally gained independence in 1828, after a conflict between Argentina and Brazil.

Like Argentina, Uruguay received many European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily from Spain and Italy. Today, most Uruguayans are of European descent, with a small percentage of mestizos and people of African descent.

Spanish is the official language of Uruguay, and Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion, although Uruguay is one of the most secular countries in Latin America.

### Government and Economy

Uruguay is known for its stable democracy and progressive social policies. It was one of the first countries in the world to establish a welfare state, providing universal healthcare, free education, and other social services. The country has also been at the forefront of progressive legislation, including the legalization of marijuana and same-sex marriage.

Uruguay's economy is based on agriculture, particularly cattle ranching and sheep farming. The country is a major exporter of beef, wool, and dairy products. Tourism is also an important industry, with many visitors coming from Argentina and Brazil to enjoy Uruguay's beaches and historic cities.

Like Argentina, Uruguay is a member of Mercosur, which has helped to integrate its economy with those of its larger neighbors. The country has a relatively high standard of living compared to many other Latin American countries, with a large middle class and relatively low levels of poverty and inequality.

### Montevideo

Montevideo, Uruguay's capital and largest city, is home to about one-third of the country's population. The city is located on the north shore of the Río de la Plata estuary, directly across from Buenos Aires.

Montevideo has a rich cultural heritage, with well-preserved colonial architecture, numerous museums and theaters, and a vibrant music scene. The city's historic center, Ciudad Vieja (Old City), features many buildings from the Spanish colonial era.

The port of Montevideo is one of the most important in South America and plays a crucial role in Uruguay's economy. The city is also a popular tourist destination, known for its beautiful beaches, historic sites, and cultural attractions.

## Paraguay

Paraguay shares borders with Bolivia, Brazil, and Argentina. It is a **landlocked** country. Landlocked means completely surrounded by land with no direct access to the ocean. The Paraguay River divides the country into two regions. East of the river is the country's most productive farmland. Ranchers also graze livestock in some parts of western Paraguay.

### History

Paraguay was claimed by Spanish settlers in the mid-1530s. It remained a Spanish colony until 1811, when it won independence. From independence until 1989, Paraguay was ruled off and on by dictators. Today, the country has elected leaders and a democratic government.

Paraguay's history has been marked by two devastating wars. The War of the Triple Alliance (1864-1870), in which Paraguay fought against Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, resulted in the death of a large portion of Paraguay's male population and the loss of significant territory. The Chaco War (1932-1935) with Bolivia was less destructive but still had a significant impact on the country.

### People

A great majority—about 95 percent—of Paraguayans are mestizos. Indians and people of mostly European descent make up the rest of the population. Paraguay has two official languages. Almost all people in Paraguay speak both Spanish and Guarani (gwah-ruh-NEE), an Indian language. As in Uruguay, most people are Roman Catholic.

Paraguay's capital and largest city is Asunción (ah-soon-SYOHN). The city is located along the Paraguay River near the border with Argentina.

### Economy

Much of Paraguay's wealth is controlled by a few rich families and companies. These families and companies have tremendous influence over the country's government.

Agriculture is an important part of the economy. In fact, nearly half of the country's workers are farmers. Many of these farmers grow just enough food to feed themselves and their families. They grow crops such as corn, cotton, soybeans, and sugarcane. Paraguay also has many small businesses but not much industry.

Paraguay's future may be promising as the country learns how to use its resources more effectively. For example, the country has built large hydroelectric dams on the Paraná River. These dams provide more power than Paraguay needs, so Paraguay is able to sell the surplus electricity to Brazil and Argentina.

## Summary

In this lesson you learned that the people of Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay share some aspects of their European heritage. Their economies are also closely tied. Argentina, the largest of the three countries, has a diverse economy but has faced economic challenges. Uruguay, though small, has a stable democracy and a relatively high standard of living. Paraguay, the most rural of the three, is working to develop its resources and improve its economy.
