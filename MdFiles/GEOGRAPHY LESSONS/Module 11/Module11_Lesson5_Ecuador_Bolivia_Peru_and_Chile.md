## If YOU lived there...
You live in Cuzco, the capital of the Inca Empire. You are required to contribute labor to the empire, and you have been chosen to work on a construction project. Hauling the huge stones will be difficult, but the work will be rewarding. You can either choose to help build a magnificent temple to the sun god or you can help build a road from Cuzco to the far end of the empire.

**Which project will you choose? Why?**

## Pacific South America's History

Thousands of years ago, people in Pacific South America learned how to adapt to and modify their environments. They built stone terraces into the steep mountainsides so they could raise crops. In coastal areas, people created irrigation systems to store water and control flooding.

### The Inca Empire

Eventually, one culture came to rule most of the region. By the early 1500s, these people, the Incas, controlled an area that stretched from northern Ecuador to central Chile.

The Incas built a vast empire with a complex government and society. They constructed thousands of miles of paved roads through the rugged Andes mountains. These roads connected the far reaches of the empire to the capital city of Cuzco, located in what is now Peru.

The Incas were skilled engineers and architects. They built impressive stone structures, including temples, palaces, and fortresses. The stones in these buildings were cut so precisely that they fit together without mortar. Many of these structures still stand today, despite centuries of earthquakes in the region.

As advanced as their civilization was, the Incas had no wheeled vehicles or horses. Instead, relay teams of runners carried messages from one end of the empire to the other. Working together, a team of runners could carry a message up to 150 miles (240 km) in one day. The runners did not carry any letters, however, because the Incas did not have a written language.

### Spanish Rule

In spite of its great organization, however, the Inca Empire did not last long. A new Inca ruler, on his way to claim the throne, was captured by Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro in 1532. The Spanish had superior weapons and horses, which gave them a significant advantage over the Incas. They also brought diseases that killed many Incas. Within a few years, the Spanish had conquered the entire empire.

The Spanish established the Viceroyalty of Peru, which included most of Spanish South America. A **viceroy**, or royal governor, ruled the territory in the name of the Spanish king. The Spanish built cities, established large estates, and forced the native peoples to work in mines and on farms.

The Spanish brought their language, religion, and culture to the region. They built grand churches and government buildings in the colonial cities. However, many indigenous people continued to speak their native languages and maintain their traditional customs, especially in remote areas.

### Independence

By the early 1800s, many people in Spanish America were dissatisfied with colonial rule. The **Creoles** (people of Spanish descent born in the Americas) resented being treated as second-class citizens compared to those born in Spain. They were influenced by Enlightenment ideas about liberty and equality, as well as by the American and French Revolutions.

In the 1810s and 1820s, independence movements spread throughout Spanish America. Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín were key leaders in the revolts. The success of the revolts led to independence for Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia by 1825.

After independence, these countries faced many challenges, including political instability, economic problems, and social inequality. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, they experienced periods of democracy, dictatorship, and civil conflict.

## Culture of Pacific South America

The culture of Pacific South America reflects both indigenous and Spanish influences. This blend is evident in the region's languages, religions, arts, and daily life.

### Languages

Spanish is the official language of Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Bolivia. However, many people in these countries speak indigenous languages in addition to or instead of Spanish. In Bolivia, two native languages, Quechua and Aymara, are also official languages. In fact, more people in Bolivia speak native languages than in any other South American country.

Quechua, the language of the Incas, is still spoken by millions of people in the Andean highlands of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Aymara is spoken primarily in the area around Lake Titicaca, which straddles the border between Peru and Bolivia.

### Religion

The majority of people in Pacific South America are Roman Catholic, a legacy of Spanish colonization. However, many indigenous people combine Catholic beliefs and practices with traditional Andean religious elements. For example, they may honor both Catholic saints and Pachamama, the Andean earth goddess.

In recent decades, evangelical Protestant churches have grown in the region, particularly among indigenous communities. There are also small Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist communities, especially in the larger cities.

### Arts and Traditions

The arts of Pacific South America blend indigenous and European influences. Traditional Andean music features instruments such as the charango (a small stringed instrument), the quena (a flute), and the zampoña (pan pipes). These are often combined with European instruments like the guitar and violin.

Textiles are an important art form in the Andean region. Indigenous communities produce colorful woven textiles with intricate patterns that often have symbolic meanings. These textiles are used for clothing, blankets, and decorative items.

Traditional festivals in the region often combine Catholic and indigenous elements. For example, the Inti Raymi (Festival of the Sun) in Cuzco, Peru, celebrates the Inca sun god while also incorporating Catholic elements.

## Ecuador Today

In recent decades, the countries of Pacific South America have all experienced political and economic challenges. Ecuador, like its neighbors, has struggled with poverty and political instability.

### Geography and People

Ecuador is named for its location on the equator. The country has three distinct geographical regions: the coastal lowlands, the Andean highlands, and the Amazon Basin. Each region has its own climate, resources, and cultural traditions.

**Quito**, Ecuador's capital, is located high in the Andes mountains. It has a well-preserved colonial center that has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. Guayaquil, on the coast, is Ecuador's largest city and main port.

Ecuador has a diverse population. About 70 percent of Ecuadorians are mestizos (of mixed European and indigenous ancestry). About 25 percent are indigenous, and the remainder are of European or African descent.

### Economy and Challenges

Ecuador's economy is based primarily on oil exports, agriculture, and remittances (money sent home by Ecuadorians working abroad). The country is a major exporter of bananas, shrimp, and flowers.

Oil is Ecuador's most valuable resource. It accounts for about half of the country's export earnings. However, dependence on oil has both benefits and drawbacks. The country's economy suffers if the world oil price drops. In addition, oil extraction has caused environmental damage in the Amazon region.

Ecuador has faced significant economic challenges, including high inflation, unemployment, and external debt. In 2000, after a severe economic crisis, Ecuador adopted the U.S. dollar as its official currency to stabilize its economy.

Political instability has been another challenge for Ecuador. Between 1997 and 2007, the country had seven different presidents. Some were forced from office by protests or coups. In recent years, Ecuador has achieved greater political stability, but tensions remain between different political factions and social groups.

## Bolivia Today

Like Ecuador, Bolivia is a poor country. Poverty has been a cause of political instability. In recent years, Bolivia has elected leaders who promise to help the poor, especially the country's large indigenous population.

### Geography and Government

Bolivia's government is divided between two capital cities. The supreme court meets in Sucre (soo-kray), but the congress meets in **La Paz**. La Paz, located at an elevation of about 12,000 feet (3,650 m), is the world's highest capital city.

Bolivia is a landlocked country, which means it has no direct access to the sea. This has been a significant disadvantage for Bolivia's economic development, as it makes international trade more difficult and expensive.

The country has three main geographical regions: the Andean highlands (Altiplano), the semi-tropical valleys of the eastern mountain slopes, and the lowland plains of the Amazon Basin.

### People and Economy

Bolivia has the highest percentage of indigenous people in South America. About 60 percent of Bolivians are of indigenous descent, primarily Quechua and Aymara. The rest are mestizos or of European descent.

Bolivia's economy is based on mining, agriculture, and natural gas production. The country has significant mineral resources, including tin, zinc, and silver. In recent years, natural gas has become Bolivia's most valuable export.

Despite its natural resources, Bolivia remains one of the poorest countries in South America. Many Bolivians work in the informal economy, selling goods on the street or working in small-scale agriculture. The country has high levels of inequality, with wealth concentrated among a small elite.

In 2005, Bolivia elected its first indigenous president, Evo Morales. Morales implemented policies aimed at reducing poverty and increasing the role of the state in the economy. These included nationalizing the oil and gas industry and redistributing land to poor farmers. While these policies have been popular with many Bolivians, they have also been controversial and have led to tensions with foreign investors and neighboring countries.

## Peru Today

Peru is the largest and most populous country in Pacific South America. Today, it is making some progress against political violence and poverty.

### Geography and People

Peru has three distinct geographical regions: the arid coastal plain, the Andean highlands, and the Amazon rainforest. Each region has its own climate, resources, and cultural traditions.

**Lima**, Peru's capital and largest city, is located on the coast. It is home to about one-third of the country's population. The city has grown rapidly in recent decades as people have migrated from rural areas in search of economic opportunities.

Peru has a diverse population. About 45 percent of Peruvians are indigenous, primarily Quechua and Aymara. Another 37 percent are mestizo, and the remainder are of European, African, or Asian descent.

### History of Conflict

From the 1980s to the early 2000s, Peru experienced a violent conflict between the government and guerrilla groups, particularly the Shining Path. The conflict resulted in the deaths of an estimated 70,000 people, many of them indigenous peasants caught in the crossfire.

During this period, many Peruvians fled the violence in the highlands and moved to Lima. This rapid urbanization created challenges, including the growth of shantytowns on the outskirts of the city and strain on urban services.

In the early 2000s, Peru began to recover from the conflict. The country established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate human rights abuses during the conflict and to help the country heal.

### Economy and Development

Peru's economy is based on mining, agriculture, fishing, and tourism. The country is a major producer of copper, gold, and silver. It also exports agricultural products such as asparagus, coffee, and fruit.

In recent years, Peru has experienced strong economic growth, driven by high commodity prices and sound economic policies. This growth has helped reduce poverty, although significant challenges remain, particularly in rural areas.

Tourism is an important and growing sector of Peru's economy. The country's rich cultural heritage, including Machu Picchu and other Inca sites, attracts millions of visitors each year. The government has invested in infrastructure and promotion to develop the tourism industry.

## Chile Today

Like Peru, Chile has ended a long violent period. Chile now has a stable government and a growing economy. It is often considered one of the most developed and stable countries in Latin America.

### Geography and People

Chile is a long, narrow country that stretches more than 2,600 miles (4,200 km) from north to south. It is bordered by the Andes mountains on the east and the Pacific Ocean on the west. This unique geography gives Chile a wide range of climates and landscapes, from the Atacama Desert in the north (one of the driest places on Earth) to the glaciers and fjords of Patagonia in the south.

**Santiago**, Chile's capital and largest city, is located in the central valley between the Andes and the coastal mountains. It is the political, economic, and cultural center of the country.

Chile has a relatively homogeneous population compared to other South American countries. About 88 percent of Chileans are mestizo, 10 percent are indigenous (primarily Mapuche), and 2 percent are of European descent.

### Political Stability and Economy

From 1973 to 1990, Chile was ruled by a military dictatorship led by General Augusto Pinochet. The dictatorship was characterized by human rights abuses, including the disappearance and execution of political opponents. In 1990, Chile returned to democracy, and since then, it has maintained political stability.

Chile has one of the strongest economies in Latin America. It has pursued free-market economic policies, including privatization of state-owned enterprises, deregulation, and free trade agreements with countries around the world. Chile was the first South American country to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of mostly wealthy, developed nations.

The country's economy is based on exports of minerals, agricultural products, and manufactured goods. Chile is the world's largest producer of copper, which accounts for about one-third of its exports. The central valley of Chile has a Mediterranean climate that is ideal for agriculture. Chilean fruit and wine are exported around the world.

Farming, fishing, forestry, and mining form the basis of Chile's economy. Copper mining is especially important. It accounts for more than one-third of Chile's exports.

Chile's economic stability was rocked by a massive earthquake that struck on February 27, 2010. The quake killed about 500 Chileans and caused about $30 billion of damage to buildings, homes, and streets. Today, Chile's people and government continue to rebuild their nation.

## Summary

In this lesson you learned that Pacific South America was home to one of the greatest ancient civilizations in the Americas—the Inca. The Spanish conquered the Incas. Today, the region's culture still reflects Inca and Spanish influences. In recent years Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile have struggled with political violence and poverty. However, Peru and Chile are recovering.
