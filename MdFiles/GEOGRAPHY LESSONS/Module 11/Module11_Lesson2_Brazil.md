## If YOU lived there...
You live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's second-largest city. For months your friends have been preparing for Carnival, the year's biggest holiday. During Carnival, people perform in glittery costumes and there is dancing all day and all night in the streets. The city is packed with tourists. It can be fun, but it is hectic! Your family is thinking of leaving Rio during Carnival so they can get some peace and quiet, but you may stay in Rio with a friend if you like.

**Would you stay for Carnival? Why or why not?**

## History

Brazil is the largest country in South America. Its population of about 211 million people is larger than the population of all of the other South American countries combined. Most Brazilians are descended from three diverse groups of people whose experiences have contributed in different ways throughout Brazil's history.

### Colonial Brazil

The area that is now Brazil was originally home to different groups of native peoples. They arrived in the region many thousands of years ago and developed a way of life based on hunting, fishing, and small-scale farming.

In 1500 Portuguese explorers became the first Europeans to reach Brazil. They claimed the land for Portugal. For the next three centuries, Brazil was a Portuguese colony. The Portuguese established large plantations along the coast, where they grew sugarcane and other crops for export to Europe.

To work these plantations, the Portuguese first tried to enslave the native peoples. However, many natives died from European diseases, and others fled into the interior. The Portuguese then began importing enslaved Africans. Between the 1500s and the 1800s, more than 3 million enslaved Africans were brought to Brazil. This was more than one-third of all the Africans brought to the Americas during the slave trade.

### Independence and After

In 1808, the Portuguese royal family fled to Brazil to escape the armies of French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, who had invaded Portugal. The presence of the royal family raised Brazil's status, and in 1815 it was declared a kingdom united with Portugal.

When the Portuguese king returned to Portugal in 1821, he left his son Pedro in charge of Brazil. The following year, Pedro declared Brazil's independence from Portugal and became Emperor Pedro I of Brazil. Unlike most other Latin American countries, which became republics after independence, Brazil remained a monarchy until 1889, when a military coup established a republic.

Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Brazil experienced periods of political instability, alternating between democratic governments and military dictatorships. Since 1985, Brazil has been a democratic republic.

## Society

Brazil's society reflects its history as a meeting place of different cultures. The country's population includes people of European, African, and indigenous descent, as well as many people of mixed ancestry.

### People

Most Brazilians today are of mixed ancestry. About 48 percent of the population is of mixed European and African descent. Another 43 percent is of European descent, primarily Portuguese but also including Italian, German, and other European backgrounds. About 8 percent of Brazilians are of African descent, and less than 1 percent are indigenous.

Brazil's population is unevenly distributed. Most people live along the Atlantic coast, particularly in the southeast. The interior of the country, including the Amazon Basin, is sparsely populated.

### Language and Religion

Portuguese is the official language of Brazil and is spoken by virtually all Brazilians. Brazilian Portuguese has evolved differently from the Portuguese spoken in Portugal, with differences in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar.

The vast majority of Brazilians (about 65 percent) are Roman Catholic, making Brazil the country with the largest Catholic population in the world. However, in recent decades, evangelical Protestant churches have grown rapidly and now account for about 22 percent of the population. There are also practitioners of Candomblé and Umbanda, religions that combine beliefs and practices of African and Indian religions with Christianity.

### Culture

Brazilian culture is a vibrant mix of Portuguese, African, and indigenous influences. This cultural blend is evident in Brazil's music, dance, cuisine, and festivals.

Music is an important part of Brazilian culture. Samba, a rhythmic dance music with African roots, is perhaps Brazil's most famous musical style. Bossa nova, a softer, more melodic style that emerged in the 1950s, has also gained international popularity.

Carnival is Brazil's most famous festival. It is celebrated in the days leading up to Lent, the 40-day period of fasting and prayer observed by Catholics before Easter. Carnival features elaborate parades with colorful costumes, music, and dancing. The celebration mixes traditions from Africa, Brazil, and Europe. The most famous Carnival celebrations take place in Rio de Janeiro and Salvador.

Brazilian cuisine also reflects the country's diverse cultural heritage. Feijoada, a stew of black beans and various meats, is considered Brazil's national dish. It has roots in the food prepared by enslaved Africans. Other popular foods include rice, beans, tropical fruits, and churrasco (Brazilian barbecue).

## Regions of Brazil

Brazil's regions differ from each other in their people, climates, economies, and landscapes.

### The Southeast

The Southeast is Brazil's most populous and economically developed region. It includes the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Espírito Santo.

**São Paulo** is Brazil's largest city and one of the world's largest cities. It is a **megacity**, a city with a population of more than 10 million people. São Paulo is Brazil's financial and industrial center, producing automobiles, aircraft, and a wide range of consumer goods.

**Rio de Janeiro**, Brazil's second-largest city, is known for its beautiful beaches, including the famous Copacabana and Ipanema. Rio was Brazil's capital until 1960 and remains an important cultural center. The city is dominated by the statue of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado Mountain, one of Brazil's most recognizable landmarks.

Despite the region's wealth, many people in southeastern Brazil live in poverty. In the cities, millions of poor Brazilians live in **favelas**, or shantytowns, on the outskirts of urban areas. These neighborhoods often lack basic services such as clean water, sewage systems, and electricity.

### The Northeast

The Northeast was the first part of Brazil to be colonized by the Portuguese. It was once the center of Brazil's sugar industry, but today it is the country's poorest region. Many people in the Northeast are subsistence farmers, growing just enough food to feed their families.

The Northeast has a semi-arid climate with periodic droughts. These droughts, combined with unequal land ownership and limited economic opportunities, have led many people to migrate from the Northeast to the more prosperous Southeast.

Despite its economic challenges, the Northeast has a rich cultural heritage. The region's music, dance, and cuisine show strong African influences. Salvador, the capital of the state of Bahia, is known for its well-preserved colonial architecture and vibrant Afro-Brazilian culture.

### The Interior

The Interior region of Brazil is a frontier land. Few people live there, except for those who reside in the country's capital, **Brasília**.

In the mid-1950s government officials hoped that building a new capital city in the Brazilian interior would help develop the region. Brasília has modern buildings and busy highways. The city was planned and built from scratch in the late 1950s and was inaugurated as Brazil's capital in 1960. Its distinctive modernist architecture, designed by architect Oscar Niemeyer, has earned it UNESCO World Heritage status.

Despite the development of Brasília, much of Brazil's interior remains sparsely populated. The region includes the Cerrado, a vast tropical savanna, and parts of the Pantanal, one of the world's largest wetlands.

### The Amazon

The Amazon region covers the northern part of Brazil. **Manaus**, which lies 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from the mouth of the Amazon, is a major port and industrial city. About 2 million people live there. They rely on the river for transportation and communication.

Isolated Indian villages are scattered throughout the region's dense rain forest. Some of Brazil's Indians had little contact with outsiders until recently. Now, logging, mining, and new roads are bringing more people and development to this region.

This new development provides needed income for some people. For example, people need wood for building and making paper. Also, farmers, loggers, and miners need to make a living. But new development destroys large areas of the rain forest. This deforestation in the Amazon also threatens the survival of many plant and animal species. Deforestation threatens hundreds of unique ecosystems. It also creates tensions among the Brazilian Indians, new settlers, miners, and the government.

## Summary

In this lesson you read about Brazil—a huge country of many contrasts. Brazil reflects the mixing of people and cultures from its history. The country's diverse regions include the economically developed Southeast, the culturally rich but economically challenged Northeast, the sparsely populated Interior, and the environmentally significant Amazon region.

## Assessment
