## If YOU lived there...
You live in the beautiful colonial city of Cartagena, on the coast of the Caribbean. Your family runs a small restaurant there. You're used to the city's wide beaches and old colonial buildings with wooden balconies that overhang the street. Now you are on your way to visit your cousins. They live on a cattle ranch on the inland plains region called the Llanos.

**How do you think life on the ranch is different from yours?**

## Colombia's History

Giant mounds of earth, mysterious statues, and tombs—these are marks of the people who lived in Colombia more than 1,500 years ago. Colombia's history begins with these people. It also includes conquest by Spain and, later, independence.

### The Chibcha

In ancient times, the Chibcha Indians in Colombia inspired legends of a land rich in gold. A well-developed civilization, the Chibcha lived in the highlands of central Colombia. They were skilled farmers and craftsworkers. The Chibcha were especially known for their goldwork. They made beautiful gold ornaments and figurines.

According to legend, the Chibcha king covered himself with gold dust for religious ceremonies. He then washed the gold dust off in a sacred lake. This legend gave rise to the myth of El Dorado, a city of gold that Spanish explorers searched for but never found.

### Spanish Conquest

In the early 1500s, Spanish explorers arrived in what is now Colombia. They were eager to expand Spain's new empire. In doing so, the Spanish conquered the Chibcha and seized much of their treasure. Soon after claiming land for themselves, the Spaniards founded a colony and cities along the Caribbean coast.

**Cartagena** was one of the first cities the Spanish founded. It became an important port for shipping gold and other treasures back to Spain. The Spanish built massive stone walls around Cartagena to protect it from pirates and rival European powers. These walls still stand today, making Cartagena one of the best-preserved colonial cities in the Americas.

The Spanish also established settlements in the interior highlands, including Santa Fe de **Bogotá** (now simply called Bogotá), which became the capital of the colony. The Spanish brought their language, religion, and culture to Colombia, which remain influential today.

### Independence

By the early 1800s, many people in Spanish America were dissatisfied with colonial rule. In Colombia, a lawyer and military leader named Simón Bolívar led the fight for independence. Bolívar's forces defeated the Spanish in 1819, and Colombia became part of a new country called Gran Colombia, which also included what are now Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama.

However, Gran Colombia soon broke apart due to regional differences and political conflicts. By 1830, Colombia (then called New Granada), Venezuela, and Ecuador had become separate countries. Panama remained part of Colombia until 1903, when it became independent with support from the United States.

After independence, Colombia experienced periods of political instability, civil wars, and economic challenges. The country was divided between two main political parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives, whose conflicts sometimes erupted into violence.

## Colombia Today

Colombia is Caribbean South America's most populous country. The national capital is Bogotá, a city located high in the eastern Andes. Bogotá is a modern metropolis with a population of over 7 million people. It is Colombia's political, economic, and cultural center.

### People and Culture

Colombia's population is diverse, reflecting the country's history of indigenous cultures, European colonization, and African slavery. Most Colombians are mestizos (of mixed European and indigenous ancestry) or of European descent. There are also significant Afro-Colombian and indigenous minorities.

Most Colombians live in cities and towns in the highlands of the Andes mountains. Others live in coastal cities like Cartagena and Barranquilla. Some Colombians live on cattle ranches scattered throughout the Llanos. Few people live in the tropical rain forest regions in the south.

Colombian culture is an interesting mix of influences:
- Music: traditional African songs and dances on the Caribbean coast
- Sports: soccer and cycling are popular throughout the country
- Religion: most Colombians are Roman Catholic
- Language: Spanish is the official language, but many indigenous languages are also spoken

Colombia is known for its vibrant music and dance traditions, including cumbia and vallenato, which blend African, European, and indigenous influences. The country is also famous for its literature, particularly the works of Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel García Márquez.

### Economy

Colombia's economy depends on the country's natural resources. Recently oil has become Colombia's major export. Other natural resources include coal, gold, and emeralds. Colombia is the world's leading producer of emeralds.

Agriculture is also important to Colombia's economy. The country's varied climate and terrain allow for the cultivation of a wide range of crops. Coffee is Colombia's most famous agricultural product. The country's coffee-growing region, known as the Coffee Triangle, has ideal conditions for growing high-quality coffee beans: high altitude, rich volcanic soil, and a temperate climate with regular rainfall.

Colombia also produces bananas, cut flowers, sugar, and rice. The country is the world's second-largest exporter of cut flowers, after the Netherlands.

### Challenges

Despite its rich resources and cultural heritage, Colombia has faced significant challenges in recent decades. Since the 1960s, the country has been affected by an armed conflict involving the government, left-wing **guerrillas** (rebel groups), right-wing paramilitaries, and drug cartels.

The conflict has its roots in political and economic inequality, but it has been fueled by the illegal drug trade. Colombia became a major producer and exporter of cocaine in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to the rise of powerful drug cartels. The violence associated with the drug trade has caused thousands of deaths and displaced millions of people.

In recent years, the Colombian government has made progress in reducing violence and combating drug trafficking. In 2016, the government signed a peace agreement with the largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). However, challenges remain, including implementing the peace agreement, addressing social and economic inequality, and dealing with other armed groups that continue to operate in parts of the country.

## Venezuela's History

Venezuela was originally the home of many small tribes of South American Indians. Those groups were conquered by the Spanish in the early 1500s. The Spanish hoped to find gold and other treasures in Venezuela, but they found little. Instead, they established agricultural colonies, growing crops like cacao (used to make chocolate) and tobacco.

During the colonial period, Venezuela was part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, along with what are now Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama. The Spanish established settlements along the coast and in the highlands, but much of the interior remained largely unexplored.

### Independence

Like Colombia, Venezuela gained independence from Spain under the leadership of Simón Bolívar. Bolívar was born in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1783 to a wealthy Creole family (people of Spanish descent born in the Americas). He became a military and political leader who fought for the independence of several South American countries.

In 1811, Venezuela became the first Spanish colony in South America to declare independence. However, the Spanish soon reconquered the territory. Bolívar continued the fight, and in 1819, his forces defeated the Spanish at the Battle of Boyacá. This victory led to the creation of Gran Colombia, which included Venezuela.

As mentioned earlier, Gran Colombia broke apart by 1830, and Venezuela became an independent country. After independence, Venezuela experienced periods of political instability, including dictatorships and civil wars. In both Venezuela and Bolivia, Bolívar's birthday is a national holiday.

## Venezuela Today

**Caracas** (kah-RAH-kahs) is Venezuela's capital and the economic and cultural center of the country. The city is located in a valley near the Caribbean coast, surrounded by mountains. Caracas has a mix of modern skyscrapers, colonial architecture, and informal settlements (barrios) on the surrounding hillsides.

### People and Culture

Most Venezuelans are mestizos or of European descent, primarily Spanish and Italian. There are also significant Afro-Venezuelan and indigenous minorities. The majority of Venezuelans live in cities along the northern coast and in the Andean highlands.

Most Venezuelans are Spanish-speaking Roman Catholics, but the country's Indians speak 25 different languages and follow the religious practices of their ancestors.

Venezuelan culture includes dancing and sports. Venezuela's national dance, the joropo, is a lively foot-stomping couples' dance. Large crowds attend baseball games, the country's most popular sport. Many Venezuelan baseball players have become stars in the U.S. major leagues.

### Economy

Venezuela has some small family farms as well as large commercial farms. **Llaneros** (yah-NAY-rohs)—or Venezuelan cowboys—herd cattle on the Llanos, the vast plains that stretch across central Venezuela. The country produces coffee, cacao, and tropical fruits.

However, Venezuela's economy is dominated by oil. The country has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, primarily in the Maracaibo Basin around **Lake Maracaibo** in northwestern Venezuela. Oil was discovered in Venezuela in the early 20th century, and since then, the country's economy has been heavily dependent on oil exports.

Venezuela's wealth attracted many immigrants from Europe and other South American countries. These immigrants, like most other Venezuelans, suffered in the 1980s when the price of oil dropped sharply. Without the money provided by high oil prices, the economy couldn't support the country's growing population. Many people lost their jobs.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Venezuela experienced significant political and economic changes under the presidency of Hugo Chávez. Chávez implemented socialist policies, using oil revenue to fund social programs for the poor. However, these policies, combined with corruption and mismanagement, led to economic problems when oil prices fell.

In 2002, many Venezuelans went on **strike** to protest government policies. A strike is a refusal to work until certain demands are met. The strike severely disrupted the oil industry, which is largely controlled by the government.

Since Chávez's death in 2013, Venezuela has faced a severe economic crisis, with hyperinflation, shortages of basic goods, and political unrest. Millions of Venezuelans have left the country, creating one of the largest refugee crises in the Western Hemisphere.

## The Guianas

The countries of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana are together known as the Guianas. They are located on the northeastern coast of South America, between Venezuela and Brazil.

### Guyana

Guyana was once a British colony known as British Guiana. It gained independence in 1966 and is now a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Guyana is the only English-speaking country in South America.

The country's economy is based on agriculture and mining. Guyana's coastal plain has rich soil that is good for farming. Sugar and rice are the main crops. The interior of the country is covered with dense forests and contains valuable minerals, including gold and bauxite (used to make aluminum).

Guyana has a diverse population. About 40 percent of the people are descended from people who migrated to Guyana from India. These immigrants came to Guyana to work on the country's sugar plantations. Today, most Guyanese farm small plots of land or run small businesses. About one-third of the population is descended from former African slaves. These people operate large businesses and hold most of the government positions.

### Suriname

The resources and economy of Suriname (soohr-uh-NAHM) are similar to those of Guyana. Like Guyana, Suriname has a diverse population. The country's population includes South Asians, Africans, Chinese, Indonesians, and Creoles. The capital, Paramaribo (pah-rah-MAH-ree-boh), is home to nearly half of the country's people.

Suriname was formerly a Dutch colony, and Dutch remains the official language. The country gained independence in 1975.

### French Guiana

French Guiana (gee-A-nuh) is a territory of France and sends representatives to the government in Paris. French Guiana's roughly 200,000 people live mostly in coastal areas. About two-thirds of the people are of African descent. Other groups include Europeans, Asians, and South American Indians. The country depends heavily on imports for its food and energy.

As an overseas department of France, French Guiana is part of the European Union. The territory's economy is heavily dependent on subsidies from France and the European Space Agency's launch site at Kourou, which is used for launching satellites.

## Summary

In this lesson you learned that Colombia's history includes the Chibcha, Spanish conquest, and independence. Today, Colombia's people are dealing with a long civil war. You also found out that Venezuela's history was largely shaped by Spanish settlement. Today Venezuela's economy is based on oil. Also, to the east, the Guianas are home to a diverse population.
