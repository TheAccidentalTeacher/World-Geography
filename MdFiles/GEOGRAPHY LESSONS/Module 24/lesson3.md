# Lesson 3: Central Africa

## The Big Idea
Central Africa's history and culture have been influenced by native traditions and European colonizers.

## Main Ideas
- Great African kingdoms and European colonizers have influenced the history of Central Africa.
- The culture of Central Africa includes many ethnic groups and languages, but it has also been influenced by European colonization.
- The countries of Central Africa are mostly poor, and many are trying to recover from years of civil war.
- Challenges to peace, health, and the environment slow economic development in Central Africa.

## If YOU lived there...
You are an economic adviser in Zambia. Your country is poor, and most people are farmers. But scientists say Zambia has a lot of copper underground. With a new copper mine, you could sell valuable copper to other countries. However, the mine would destroy a lot of farmland.

**Do you support building the mine? Why or why not?**

## History
Early humans lived in Central Africa many thousands of years ago. Yet, the descendants of these people have had less impact on the region's history than people from the outside. Peoples from West Africa, and later European colonists, brought their customs to the region and changed the way people lived.

### Early History
About 2,000 years ago, new peoples began to migrate to Central Africa from West Africa. They eventually formed several kingdoms in Central Africa. Among the most important was the **Kongo Kingdom**. Founded in the 1300s, it was located near the mouth of the Congo River.

The Kongo people established trade routes to western and eastern Africa. Their kingdom grew rich from the trade of animal skins, shells, slaves, and **ivory**. Ivory is a cream-colored material that comes from elephant tusks.

In the late 1400s Europeans came to the region. They wanted the region's forest products and other resources such as ivory. They used ivory for fine furniture, jewelry, statues, and piano keys. Europeans also began to trade with some Central African kingdoms for slaves. Over a span of about 300 years, the Europeans took millions of enslaved Africans to their colonies in the Americas.

Some African kingdoms became richer by trading with Europeans. However, the slave trade weakened the region overall. It reduced the population and led to increased warfare.

### European Colonization
In the late 1800s, European nations began to claim colonies in Central Africa. Belgium's King Leopold II claimed the Congo Basin as his personal property. He forced the people there to collect rubber and ivory. Those who failed to meet their quotas were punished severely. Millions of Congolese died from overwork, disease, and starvation.

After reports of these abuses became public, the Belgian government took control of the colony from Leopold in 1908. However, conditions improved only slightly. Other European powers, including France, Germany, and Portugal, also established colonies in Central Africa.

European colonizers built roads, railroads, and ports. They established plantations to grow cash crops such as coffee, cocoa, and rubber. They also began mining operations to extract minerals such as copper and diamonds. However, these developments mainly benefited the Europeans, not the Africans.

### Independence and After
Most Central African countries gained independence in the early 1960s. However, independence did not bring immediate prosperity or stability. Many countries experienced civil wars, military coups, and economic problems.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) has had a particularly troubled history. After independence in 1960, it experienced political turmoil and civil war. From 1965 to 1997, it was ruled by Mobutu Sese Seko, who became notorious for corruption and human rights abuses. After Mobutu was overthrown, the country plunged into another civil war that involved several neighboring countries.

Other Central African countries have also experienced conflicts. Rwanda suffered a genocide in 1994 in which about 800,000 people were killed. Angola endured a 27-year civil war that ended in 2002.

In recent years, some countries have made progress toward peace and democracy. However, the legacy of colonialism and conflict continues to affect the region.

## Culture
Central Africa has a diverse culture shaped by its many ethnic groups and by European colonial influence.

### Ethnic Groups and Languages
Central Africa has hundreds of ethnic groups, each with its own language and customs. The Bantu peoples are the largest group. Other important groups include the Pygmies, who live in the forests, and the Nilotic peoples in the eastern part of the region.

Most Central Africans speak several languages. They speak their ethnic language, often one or more neighboring languages, and a European language such as French, English, or Portuguese. Many ethnic languages have different **dialects**, or variations, spoken in different areas.

### Religion
Christianity is the main religion in Central Africa, introduced by European missionaries during the colonial period. Some Central Africans practice Islam, especially in the northern parts of the region. Many people combine Christianity or Islam with traditional beliefs and practices.

### Arts and Crafts
Central Africa has a rich tradition of arts and crafts. Wood carving is an important art form. Craftspeople create masks, statues, and everyday items such as bowls and stools. Music and dance are also important parts of Central African culture. They play a role in religious ceremonies, celebrations, and everyday life.

### Village Life
Most Central Africans live in rural villages. Houses are often made of mud bricks with thatched roofs. Villages usually have a **periodic market**, where people gather to buy and sell goods on certain days of the week.

Family is very important in Central African culture. Extended families often live together or near each other. Elders are respected for their wisdom and experience.

## Economy
Central Africa is rich in natural resources, but most of its countries are poor. Years of conflict, corruption, and mismanagement have hindered economic development.

### Natural Resources
Central Africa has abundant natural resources. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, and other countries in the **copper belt** have large deposits of copper and other minerals. The region also has diamonds, gold, oil, and timber.

Despite these resources, most Central African countries have weak economies. They depend on exporting raw materials, which are subject to price fluctuations in the global market. They import manufactured goods, which are more expensive.

### Urban and Rural Economies
Most Central Africans are subsistence farmers who grow just enough food to feed their families. They grow crops such as cassava, yams, and plantains. Some also raise livestock such as goats and chickens.

Cities such as **Kinshasa** in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are growing rapidly as people move from rural areas in search of jobs. However, urban unemployment is high, and many people work in the informal economy, selling goods on the street or providing services such as transportation.

### Economic Challenges
Central Africa faces several economic challenges. One is **inflation**, or rising prices. Inflation makes it difficult for people to afford basic necessities.

Poor infrastructure is another challenge. Many roads are in bad condition, making it difficult to transport goods. Electricity and clean water are not available in many areas.

Corruption is also a problem. Government officials sometimes take bribes or steal public funds. This reduces the money available for public services and discourages foreign investment.

## Challenges and Opportunities
Central Africa faces significant challenges but also has opportunities for development.

### Health Challenges
Health problems are a major concern in Central Africa. **Malaria**, a disease spread by mosquitoes, is common. HIV/AIDS affects millions of people in the region. Many children suffer from **malnutrition**, or poor nutrition, which can lead to stunted growth and other health problems.

Access to healthcare is limited, especially in rural areas. Many people cannot afford medical treatment. There is a shortage of doctors, nurses, and medical facilities.

### Environmental Challenges
Deforestation is a serious problem in Central Africa. The region's tropical forests are being cut down for timber and to clear land for farming. This leads to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and contributes to climate change.

Mining operations often cause environmental damage. They can pollute rivers and destroy habitats. Some mining companies are working to reduce their environmental impact, but many still operate with little regulation.

### Opportunities for Development
Despite its challenges, Central Africa has opportunities for development. Its abundant natural resources, if managed properly, could provide a foundation for economic growth. Tourism is another potential growth industry, especially in countries with wildlife and natural beauty such as Rwanda and Uganda.

Some countries are making progress in addressing their problems. Rwanda has achieved political stability and economic growth since the 1994 genocide. It has improved its infrastructure and education system. Other countries could follow this example.

International aid and investment can also help Central Africa develop. However, for this to be effective, the region needs peace, good governance, and policies that benefit all citizens, not just a privileged few.
