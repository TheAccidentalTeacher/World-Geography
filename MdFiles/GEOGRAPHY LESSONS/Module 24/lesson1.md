# Lesson 1: Physical Geography

## The Big Idea
West Africa is a region mostly of plains, while the Congo River and tropical forests are important features of Central Africa's physical geography.

## Main Ideas
- West Africa's key physical features include plains and the Niger River.
- West Africa has distinct climate zones from north to south.
- Central Africa's key physical features include the Congo River Basin and tropical forests.
- Central Africa has a mostly tropical climate.

## If YOU lived there...
You are on a nature hike with a guide through the forests of the Congo Basin. It has been several hours since you have seen any other people. Sometimes your guide has to cut a path through the thick vegetation, but mostly you try not to disturb any plants or animals. Suddenly, you reach a clearing and see a group of men working hard to load huge tree trunks onto big trucks.

## Introduction to West and Central Africa

West and Central Africa are two distinct regions within the African continent, each with its own unique physical geography, climate patterns, and natural resources. These regions encompass numerous countries with diverse landscapes ranging from arid deserts to lush tropical rainforests.

### Defining the Regions

**West Africa** typically includes the following countries:
- Benin
- Burkina Faso
- Cabo Verde
- Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)
- Gambia
- Ghana
- Guinea
- Guinea-Bissau
- Liberia
- Mali
- Mauritania
- Niger
- Nigeria
- Senegal
- Sierra Leone
- Togo

**Central Africa** generally includes:
- Cameroon
- Central African Republic
- Chad
- Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
- Equatorial Guinea
- Gabon
- Republic of the Congo
- São Tomé and Príncipe

These regions are defined not only by their geographical proximity but also by shared historical experiences, cultural connections, and economic relationships.

## Physical Geography of West Africa

West Africa's physical geography is characterized by relatively flat terrain with a few highland areas and significant river systems.

### Landforms

The landscape of West Africa consists primarily of plains and plateaus:

**Coastal Plains**: A narrow band of low-lying land runs along the Atlantic coast from Senegal to Nigeria. These plains are generally less than 300 feet (91 meters) above sea level and extend inland for 50 to 100 miles (80 to 160 kilometers). The coastal plains include:
- Sandy beaches
- Lagoons and estuaries
- Mangrove swamps, particularly in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria
- Deltas, most notably the Niger Delta in Nigeria

**Interior Plains and Plateaus**: Moving inland from the coast, the land gradually rises to form plains and low plateaus:
- The Fouta Djallon highlands in Guinea reach elevations of about 5,000 feet (1,500 meters)
- The Jos Plateau in central Nigeria rises to about 4,000 feet (1,200 meters)
- The Air Mountains in northern Niger reach heights of over 6,000 feet (1,800 meters)

**The Sahel**: This transitional zone between the Sahara Desert and the more fertile regions to the south is characterized by semi-arid plains and scattered acacia trees. The Sahel stretches across northern Senegal, southern Mauritania, central Mali, northern Burkina Faso, southern Niger, and northern Nigeria.

**The Sahara Desert**: The southern edge of the world's largest desert extends into northern West Africa, covering much of Mauritania, Mali, and Niger. This harsh landscape features:
- Sand dunes (ergs)
- Rocky plateaus (hamadas)
- Gravel plains (regs)
- Occasional oases where groundwater reaches the surface

### River Systems

West Africa has several major river systems that have shaped the region's geography, settlement patterns, and economic activities:

**The Niger River**: Africa's third-longest river (after the Nile and the Congo) flows in a unique arc through West Africa:
- It begins in the highlands of Guinea
- Flows northeast into Mali
- Turns southeast in Niger
- Eventually empties into the Gulf of Guinea in Nigeria
- Has a total length of about 2,600 miles (4,180 kilometers)

A distinctive feature of the Niger is its **inland delta** in central Mali, where the river spreads out into numerous channels and wetlands covering about 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers). This area is crucial for agriculture, fishing, and grazing.

**The Senegal River**: Forms the border between Senegal and Mauritania for much of its course and is an important source of water for both countries.

**The Volta River System**: Includes the Black Volta, White Volta, and Red Volta, which converge to form Lake Volta in Ghana, one of the world's largest artificial lakes.

**The Gambia River**: Flows through the center of The Gambia, one of Africa's smallest countries, which is almost entirely defined by the river's watershed.

These rivers are vital for:
- Transportation and trade
- Irrigation for agriculture
- Fishing
- Hydroelectric power generation
- Drinking water

### Coastline

West Africa has about 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers) of Atlantic coastline, which varies in character:
- Sandy beaches and barrier islands
- Rocky sections, particularly in Guinea
- Extensive mangrove forests in Guinea-Bissau and parts of Nigeria
- Lagoons and coastal lakes, especially in Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Côte d'Ivoire

Major ports along the coast include:
- Dakar (Senegal)
- Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire)
- Tema (Ghana)
- Lagos (Nigeria)

## Climate of West Africa

West Africa's climate is primarily influenced by its latitude and the seasonal movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a band of low pressure and rainfall that shifts north and south with the seasons.

### Climate Zones

West Africa has distinct climate zones that run in east-west bands from the coast to the Sahara:

**Tropical Rainforest Climate**: Found along the coast from Guinea to Nigeria, this zone features:
- High temperatures year-round (averaging 75-85°F or 24-29°C)
- Heavy rainfall (60-160 inches or 150-400 cm annually)
- High humidity
- Two rainy seasons in many areas

**Tropical Savanna Climate**: North of the rainforest zone, the savanna covers much of the interior of West Africa:
- Distinct wet and dry seasons
- Moderate rainfall (20-60 inches or 50-150 cm annually)
- Higher temperature variations than the rainforest
- Vegetation transitions from woodland savanna in the south to grassland in the north

**Semi-Arid (Sahel) Climate**: The transitional zone between the savanna and the desert:
- Short rainy season and long dry season
- Low annual rainfall (10-20 inches or 25-50 cm)
- High daytime temperatures and cooler nights
- Drought-resistant vegetation

**Desert Climate**: The Sahara in the northernmost parts of West Africa:
- Extremely low rainfall (less than 10 inches or 25 cm annually)
- Extreme temperature variations between day and night
- Very low humidity
- Sparse vegetation limited to oases and seasonal watercourses

### Seasonal Patterns

West Africa experiences distinct seasonal patterns:

**Wet Season (Roughly May to October)**:
- The ITCZ moves northward
- Moist air from the Atlantic brings rainfall
- Temperatures are somewhat moderated by cloud cover
- Vegetation flourishes

**Dry Season (Roughly November to April)**:
- The ITCZ moves southward
- Dry, dusty **harmattan** winds blow from the Sahara
- Little or no rainfall
- Higher temperatures, especially toward the end of the dry season
- Vegetation becomes dormant or dies back

The timing and duration of these seasons vary by latitude, with areas closer to the equator having longer wet seasons and shorter dry seasons.

### Climate Challenges

West Africa faces several climate-related challenges:

**Drought**: Periodic droughts, particularly in the Sahel, have caused:
- Crop failures
- Livestock deaths
- Food insecurity
- Migration to urban areas or more fertile regions

**Desertification**: The Sahara is expanding southward in many areas due to:
- Climate change
- Overgrazing
- Deforestation
- Unsustainable agricultural practices

**Flooding**: During the wet season, heavy rains can cause flooding in:
- Urban areas with poor drainage
- River valleys, particularly the Niger inland delta
- Coastal regions during storms

**Climate Change**: The region is experiencing:
- More erratic rainfall patterns
- Higher average temperatures
- More frequent extreme weather events
- Rising sea levels threatening coastal areas

These climate challenges have significant implications for agriculture, water resources, human settlement, and economic development in West Africa.

## Physical Geography of Central Africa

Central Africa's physical geography is dominated by the Congo River Basin and its extensive tropical forests.

### Landforms

Central Africa's terrain includes several distinct features:

**Congo Basin**: The heart of Central Africa is the vast Congo Basin, a depression that covers much of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and parts of neighboring countries. This basin:
- Is roughly circular in shape
- Has an average elevation of about 1,000 feet (300 meters)
- Is surrounded by higher land on all sides
- Contains the world's second-largest tropical rainforest after the Amazon

**Plateaus and Highlands**: The basin is ringed by plateaus and highlands:
- The Adamawa Highlands in Cameroon reach elevations of over 7,000 feet (2,100 meters)
- The Crystal Mountains in Gabon rise to about 3,000 feet (900 meters)
- The Mitumba Mountains along the eastern edge of the DRC form part of the Great Rift Valley system

**Great Rift Valley**: The western branch of East Africa's Great Rift Valley forms part of Central Africa's eastern border. Features include:
- Lake Albert, Lake Edward, and Lake Kivu
- Mountains and volcanoes, including Mount Cameroon (13,255 feet/4,040 meters), the highest point in West and Central Africa

**Coastal Plains**: A narrow coastal plain runs along the Atlantic coast of Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo.

### The Congo River System

The **Congo River** (also called the Zaire River) is the defining feature of Central Africa's geography:
- It is Africa's second-longest river (after the Nile) at about 2,900 miles (4,700 kilometers)
- It has the second-highest volume of water discharge in the world (after the Amazon)
- Its drainage basin covers about 1.5 million square miles (4 million square kilometers)
- It forms a large arc, flowing north, west, and then southwest before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean

The Congo River system includes numerous major tributaries:
- The Ubangi River forms part of the border between the Central African Republic and the DRC
- The Kasai River drains southern DRC
- The Aruwimi, Lomami, and Lualaba rivers are other significant tributaries

The river system features:
- Rapids and waterfalls, particularly at Livingstone Falls near the mouth
- A wide, navigable channel for much of its course
- Extensive floodplains and swamps in some areas

The Congo River is crucial for:
- Transportation (it's the main "highway" through the dense forest)
- Hydroelectric power generation
- Fishing
- Drinking water and sanitation

### Forests and Vegetation

Central Africa contains the **Congo Rainforest**, the world's second-largest tropical rainforest:
- It covers about 780,000 square miles (2 million square kilometers)
- It spans six countries: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, DRC, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon
- It contains extraordinary biodiversity, including forest elephants, gorillas, chimpanzees, and thousands of plant species
- It has multiple layers, from the forest floor to the understory, canopy, and emergent layers

Beyond the rainforest, Central Africa includes:
- **Transition forests** between rainforest and savanna
- **Savanna grasslands** in northern Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic
- **Mangrove forests** along parts of the Atlantic coast
- **Mountain forests** at higher elevations

## Climate of Central Africa

Central Africa's climate is primarily tropical, influenced by its equatorial location and the Congo Basin's topography.

### Seasonal Patterns

Central Africa's seasonal patterns are less pronounced than those in West Africa, particularly near the equator:

**Near the Equator** (DRC, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of the Congo):
- Rainfall throughout the year
- Two slightly wetter periods (roughly April-June and September-November)
- Two slightly drier periods (roughly December-February and July-August)
- Little temperature variation throughout the year

**North and South of the Equator**:
- More distinct wet and dry seasons
- In the north (Chad, northern Cameroon, northern Central African Republic): wet season from May to October
- In the south (southern DRC): wet season from November to April
- The timing of seasons is reversed north and south of the equator

### Climate Challenges

Central Africa faces several climate-related challenges:

**Deforestation**: The Congo Rainforest is being cleared at an alarming rate due to:
