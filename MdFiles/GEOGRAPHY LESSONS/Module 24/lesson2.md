# Lesson 2: West Africa

## The Big Idea
Powerful early kingdoms, European slave trade and colonization, and traditions from a mix of ethnic groups have all influenced West African culture.

## Main Ideas
- In West Africa's history, trade made great kingdoms rich, but this greatness declined as Europeans began to control trade routes.
- The culture of West Africa includes many different ethnic groups, languages, religions, and housing styles.
- Most coastal countries of West Africa have struggling economies and weak or unstable governments.
- Lack of resources in the Sahel countries is a main challenge to economic development.

## If YOU lived there...
You live in the Sahel country of Niger, where your family herds cattle. You travel with your animals to find good grazing land for them. In the past few years, however, the desert has been expanding. It is getting harder and harder to find good grass and water for your cattle. You worry about the coming years.

## History
Much of what we know about West Africa's early history is based on archaeology. **Oral history**—a spoken record of past events—offers other clues.

### Great Kingdoms
Ancient artifacts suggest that early trading centers developed into great kingdoms in West Africa. One of the earliest kingdoms was **Ghana** (GAH-nuh). By controlling the Sahara trade in gold and salt, Ghana became rich and powerful by about 800.

According to legend, Ghana fell to a mighty warrior from a neighboring kingdom in about 1300. Under this leader, the empire of **Mali** (MAH-lee) replaced Ghana. Mali gained control of the Sahara trade routes. Mali's most famous king, **Mansa Musa**, used wealth from trade to support artists and scholars. However, invasions caused the decline of Mali by the 1500s.

As Mali declined, the kingdom of **Songhai** (SAWNG-hy) came to power. With a university, mosques, and more than 100 schools, the Songhai city of **Timbuktu** was a cultural center. By about 1600, however, invasions had weakened this kingdom.

Merchants from North Africa crossed the Sahara to trade for West African gold and salt.

### European Influence
In the 1400s, Europeans began to sail along West Africa's coast. They built trading posts and forts there. At first, they traded for gold, ivory, and pepper. By the 1500s, however, they were trading for enslaved Africans. Europeans took millions of enslaved Africans to the Americas to work on plantations.

The slave trade weakened West Africa. Millions of people were taken away. Warfare increased as kingdoms fought to control the slave trade. By the late 1800s, European nations had taken control of almost all of West Africa. They ruled these colonies until the mid-1900s, when the colonies gained independence.

## Culture
West Africa has a rich and diverse culture shaped by its many ethnic groups and historical influences.

### Ethnic Groups and Languages
West Africa has hundreds of ethnic groups. Each has its own language, customs, and traditions. The **Hausa** (HOW-suh) and **Fulani** (foo-LAH-nee) are major ethnic groups in the Sahel. The **Ashanti** (uh-SHAN-tee) and **Yoruba** (YAWR-uh-buh) are important groups in the coastal countries.

Many West Africans speak several languages. They speak their own ethnic language, the language of a neighboring group, and often a European language such as French or English.

### Religion
Most West Africans practice either Islam or Christianity. Islam is the main religion in the Sahel. Christianity is more common in the coastal countries. Many West Africans also practice **animism**, the belief that spirits live in natural objects.

### Housing
Housing styles vary across West Africa. In rural areas, people often live in round houses with cone-shaped roofs. In cities, people live in rectangular houses or apartment buildings. Many West Africans live with their **extended family**—a family group that includes parents, children, grandparents, and other relatives.

## Economy
West Africa's economy faces many challenges, with significant differences between coastal and Sahel countries.

### Coastal Countries
The coastal countries of West Africa have more resources than the Sahel countries. They grow cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, and cotton. Some have valuable minerals such as gold and diamonds. Nigeria has large oil reserves.

Despite these resources, most coastal countries have weak economies. They depend on exporting raw materials, which do not bring high prices. Many countries have unstable governments, which scares away foreign investors.

**Lagos** (LAY-gohs), Nigeria, is West Africa's largest city and a major economic center. However, it faces problems such as overcrowding, pollution, and crime.

### Sahel Countries
The Sahel countries face even greater economic challenges. They have few natural resources. Drought and **famine**—a severe shortage of food—are constant threats. Most people in the Sahel are farmers or herders who live at a subsistence level. This means they produce just enough food to survive.

The Sahel countries are among the poorest in the world. They receive aid from other countries and international organizations. However, this aid is not enough to solve their economic problems.

## Challenges and Opportunities
West Africa faces numerous challenges but also has opportunities for development.

### Environmental Challenges
Desertification—the spread of desert conditions—is a major problem in the Sahel. Overgrazing, deforestation, and climate change contribute to this problem. As the desert expands, people lose farmland and grazing land.

Water scarcity is another challenge. Many people in West Africa do not have access to clean drinking water. This leads to health problems such as cholera and dysentery.

### Political Challenges
Many West African countries have experienced political instability since independence. Military coups, civil wars, and corruption have been common. These problems have slowed economic development.

In recent years, some countries have made progress toward democracy. Ghana and Senegal, for example, have held peaceful elections and transfers of power.

### Economic Opportunities
Despite its challenges, West Africa has economic opportunities. The region has abundant natural resources, including oil, gold, and diamonds. With better management, these resources could bring greater prosperity.

Tourism is another potential growth industry. West Africa has beautiful beaches, historic sites, and diverse wildlife. However, political instability and poor infrastructure have limited tourism development.
