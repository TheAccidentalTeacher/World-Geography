# Lesson 7: Natural Resources

## The Big Idea
Earth's natural resources have many valuable uses, and their availability affects people in many ways.

## Main Ideas
- Earth provides valuable resources for our use.
- Energy resources provide fuel, heat, and electricity.

## Key Terms and Places
- natural resource
- renewable resources
- nonrenewable resources
- deforestation
- reforestation

## If YOU lived there...
You live in a small village in the Amazon rain forest. Your family has lived here for generations. Recently, a logging company has begun cutting down trees near your village. The company has offered your father a job. Some people in your village are worried about the effects of logging on the forest. Others think the jobs are more important.

**What would you think about the logging?**

## Earth's Resources

Earth provides us with many natural resources. A **natural resource** is any material from Earth that people use. There are two main types of natural resources: renewable and nonrenewable.

**Renewable resources** can be replaced in nature at a rate close to the rate at which they are used. Examples include plants, animals, water, and soil. However, if we use these resources faster than they can be replaced, they may run out. For example, if we cut down trees faster than they can grow back, we will eventually run out of trees.

**Nonrenewable resources** are replaced in nature much more slowly than they are used. Examples include minerals and fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. These resources took millions of years to form, so once we use them up, they are gone for good.

### Land Resources

Land provides many resources. We use land for farming, building homes and businesses, and recreation. Land also provides minerals, which are natural substances that make up rocks. We use minerals to make many products, from computers to jewelry.

Soil is another important land resource. Soil provides nutrients for plants, which we use for food, clothing, and shelter. However, soil can be damaged by erosion, pollution, and poor farming practices.

### Forest Resources

Forests provide many resources, including wood for building and making paper. Forests also provide habitat for wildlife, help prevent soil erosion, and remove carbon dioxide from the air.

However, forests around the world are being cut down at an alarming rate. **Deforestation** is the clearing of forests. Deforestation can lead to soil erosion, loss of wildlife habitat, and climate change.

To help protect forests, many countries practice **reforestation**, which is the replanting of trees in areas where they have been cut down. Reforestation helps restore forest resources and the benefits they provide.

### Water Resources

Water is essential for all life on Earth. We use water for drinking, cooking, bathing, and growing crops. Water also provides habitat for many plants and animals.

Most of Earth's water is salt water in the oceans. Only about 3% is fresh water, and most of that is frozen in glaciers and ice caps. This means that the amount of fresh water available for our use is very limited.

Water pollution is a serious problem in many parts of the world. Pollution can make water unsafe for drinking, swimming, and supporting wildlife.

## Energy Resources

Energy resources provide fuel, heat, and electricity. There are two main types of energy resources: nonrenewable and renewable.

### Nonrenewable Energy Resources

Fossil fuels are the most widely used nonrenewable energy resources. They include coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels formed from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.

When we burn fossil fuels, they release energy that we can use to generate electricity, power vehicles, and heat buildings. However, burning fossil fuels also releases pollutants that can harm the environment and contribute to climate change.

Nuclear energy is another nonrenewable energy resource. Nuclear power plants use uranium, a nonrenewable mineral, to generate electricity. Nuclear energy produces less air pollution than fossil fuels, but it creates radioactive waste that must be stored safely.

### Renewable Energy Resources

Renewable energy resources include solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric energy, geothermal energy, and biomass energy.

**Solar energy** comes from the sun. Solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity. Solar energy is clean and abundant, but it can be expensive to install solar panels.

**Wind energy** is generated by wind turbines. Wind is a clean, renewable resource, but wind farms require a lot of land and can be noisy.

**Hydroelectric energy** is generated by the flow of water. Dams built on rivers create reservoirs. When water is released from the reservoir, it flows through turbines, generating electricity. Hydroelectric energy is clean and renewable, but dams can disrupt river ecosystems and displace people.

**Geothermal energy** comes from heat within Earth. In some places, this heat is close enough to the surface to be used for heating buildings or generating electricity. Geothermal energy is clean and reliable, but it is only available in certain locations.

**Biomass energy** comes from burning organic materials like wood, crop waste, and garbage. Biomass is renewable, but burning it can produce air pollution.

## Managing Resources

As Earth's population grows, the demand for natural resources increases. To ensure that resources are available for future generations, we need to manage them wisely.

### Conservation

Conservation means using resources carefully to avoid waste. Here are some ways to conserve resources:

- Reduce, reuse, and recycle materials
- Use energy-efficient appliances and vehicles
- Turn off lights and electronics when not in use
- Fix leaky faucets and pipes
- Use water-efficient fixtures and appliances
- Plant trees and protect forests
- Support sustainable farming practices

### Sustainable Development

Sustainable development means meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It involves finding a balance between economic development, social well-being, and environmental protection.

Examples of sustainable development include:

- Using renewable energy sources
- Building energy-efficient homes and buildings
- Practicing sustainable agriculture
- Protecting natural habitats
- Developing public transportation systems
- Reducing waste and pollution

## Summary

Earth provides many valuable natural resources that we use every day. Some resources, like minerals and fossil fuels, are nonrenewable and will eventually run out. Others, like plants, animals, and water, are renewable but must be managed carefully.

Energy resources include nonrenewable fossil fuels and nuclear energy, as well as renewable sources like solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass energy.

To ensure that resources are available for future generations, we need to practice conservation and sustainable development. By using resources wisely and developing alternatives to nonrenewable resources, we can help protect Earth's natural resources for the future.
