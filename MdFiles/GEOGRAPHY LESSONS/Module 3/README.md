# Module 3: The Human World

## About This Module
This module explores geographic concepts that help us understand the world's people. It has been reformatted from the original PDF document into four comprehensive Markdown lessons for easier reading and reference.

## How to Use These Lessons

### File Format
All lessons are provided in Markdown (.md) format, which can be:
- Viewed directly in GitHub, GitLab, or other Markdown-compatible platforms
- Converted to Word documents using tools like Pandoc
- Printed directly from a Markdown viewer
- Imported into learning management systems that support Markdown

### Lesson Structure
Each lesson follows a consistent structure:
1. **Title and Big Idea** - The main concept of the lesson
2. **Main Ideas** - Key points covered in the lesson
3. **Key Terms** - Important vocabulary introduced in the lesson
4. **Content Sections** - Detailed explanations of concepts with examples
5. **Conclusion** - Summary of the lesson's main points

### Navigation
- Use the [Module3_Table_of_Contents.md](Module3_Table_of_Contents.md) file to navigate between lessons
- Each lesson can be read independently, though they build on each other conceptually

## Converting to Microsoft Word Format

If you prefer to use these lessons in Microsoft Word format, you can convert them using Pandoc, a free document converter:

1. Install Pandoc from [pandoc.org](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the directory containing these files
4. Run the following command for each lesson:
   ```
   pandoc -f markdown -t docx Lesson1_Elements_of_Culture.md -o Lesson1_Elements_of_Culture.docx
   ```
   (Repeat for lessons 2-4, changing the filenames accordingly)
