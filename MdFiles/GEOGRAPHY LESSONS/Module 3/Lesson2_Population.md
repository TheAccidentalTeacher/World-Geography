# Lesson 2: Population

## The Big Idea
Population studies are an important part of geography.

## Main Ideas
- The study of population patterns helps geographers learn about the world.
- Population statistics and trends are important measures of population change.

## Key Terms and Places
- population
- population density
- birthrate
- migration

## Population Patterns

How many people live in your community? Do you live in a small town, a huge city, or somewhere in between? Your community's population, or the total number of people in a given area, determines a great deal about the place in which you live. Population influences the variety of businesses, the types of transportation, and the number of schools in your community.

Because population has a huge impact on our lives, it is an important part of geography. Geographers who study human populations are particularly interested in patterns that emerge over time. They study such information as how many people live in an area, why people live where they do, and how populations change. Population patterns like these can tell us much about our world.

### Population Density

Some places on Earth are crowded with people. Others are almost empty. One statistic geographers use to examine populations is population density, a measure of the average number of people living in a square mile or square kilometer. Population density is calculated by dividing the total population of an area by the area's total land area.

Population density varies greatly around the world. For example, Monaco, a tiny country on the Mediterranean coast, has a population density of about 49,000 people per square mile. In contrast, Mongolia, a large country in Central Asia, has a population density of only about 5 people per square mile.

### Population Distribution

Population density helps us understand how crowded or empty a place is, but it doesn't tell us exactly where people live within that area. For that, geographers look at population distribution, or the pattern of where people live.

In most countries, population is not evenly distributed. People tend to cluster in areas with favorable conditions, such as fertile soil, moderate climate, and access to water. For example, in Egypt, most of the population lives along the Nile River, where water is available for farming. The rest of the country is mostly desert and sparsely populated.

## Population Change

Populations are not static; they change over time. Geographers study these changes to understand how and why populations grow, shrink, or shift.

### Birthrate and Death Rate

Two key factors that affect population change are birthrate and death rate. The birthrate is the number of live births per 1,000 people in a population in a year. The death rate is the number of deaths per 1,000 people in a population in a year.

If the birthrate is higher than the death rate, the population will grow. If the death rate is higher than the birthrate, the population will shrink. The difference between the birthrate and death rate is called the natural increase rate.

### Migration

Another factor that affects population change is migration, the movement of people from one place to another. When people move into an area, it's called immigration. When people move out of an area, it's called emigration.

People migrate for many reasons. Some are pushed from their homes by negative factors such as war, persecution, or natural disasters. Others are pulled to new places by positive factors such as job opportunities, better living conditions, or family connections.

## Population Trends

By studying population patterns and changes, geographers can identify trends and make predictions about future population changes.

### Population Growth

The world's population has grown dramatically over the past few centuries. In 1800, the world population was about 1 billion. By 1930, it had doubled to 2 billion. It took only 30 more years to reach 3 billion in 1960. The world population reached 7 billion in 2011 and is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050.

This rapid growth is due to several factors, including improved healthcare, better nutrition, and advances in agriculture that have increased food production. However, population growth rates vary widely around the world. Some countries, particularly in Africa and parts of Asia, have high growth rates, while others, especially in Europe and East Asia, have low or even negative growth rates.

### Demographic Transition

Many countries follow a pattern of population change called the demographic transition. This model describes how populations change as societies develop economically.

In the first stage, both birthrates and death rates are high, so population growth is slow. In the second stage, death rates begin to fall due to improvements in healthcare and sanitation, but birthrates remain high, leading to rapid population growth. In the third stage, birthrates also begin to fall as people have fewer children, and population growth slows. In the fourth stage, both birthrates and death rates are low, and population growth is very slow or even negative.

Different countries are at different stages of the demographic transition. Understanding where a country is in this process can help geographers predict future population changes.

## Population Challenges

Population changes can create challenges for societies. These challenges vary depending on whether a population is growing rapidly, growing slowly, or shrinking.

### Rapid Population Growth

Countries with rapidly growing populations often face challenges such as:
- Providing enough food, water, and housing for everyone
- Creating enough jobs for a growing workforce
- Building enough schools, hospitals, and other infrastructure
- Managing environmental impacts of a larger population

### Slow or Negative Population Growth

Countries with slow or negative population growth face different challenges, such as:
- Supporting an aging population with a shrinking workforce
- Maintaining economic growth with fewer workers
- Funding pension and healthcare systems for the elderly

## Conclusion

Population studies are a crucial part of geography. By understanding population patterns, changes, and trends, geographers can gain insights into how societies function and evolve. This knowledge can help communities and countries plan for the future and address the challenges that population changes may bring.
