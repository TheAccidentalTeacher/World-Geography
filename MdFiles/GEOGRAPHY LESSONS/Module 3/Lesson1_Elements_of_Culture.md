## What Is Culture?

If you traveled around the world, you would experience many different sights and sounds. You would probably hear unique music, eat a variety of foods, listen to different languages, see distinctive landscapes, and learn new customs. You would see and take part in the variety of cultures that exist in our world.

### A Way of Life

Culture is the set of beliefs, values, and practices that a group of people have in common. Culture includes many aspects of life, such as language and religion, that we may share with people around us. Everything in your day-to-day life is part of your cultureâ€”from the clothes you wear to the music you hear to the foods you eat.

On your world travels, you might notice that all societies share certain cultural features. All people have some kind of government, educate their children in some way, and create some type of art or music. However, not all societies practice their culture in the same way. For example, in Japan, the school year begins in the spring and students wear school uniforms.

### Culture Traits

The specific features of a culture are called culture traits. Culture traits include everything from language and religious beliefs to styles of clothing and types of food. Some culture traits, like the foods people eat, are directly influenced by the environment. For example, people who live near the ocean often eat more seafood than people who live inland.

Other culture traits are influenced by a group's beliefs and values. For example, in some cultures, people believe that education is very important. As a result, children in these cultures may spend many hours in school each day.

### Culture Regions

Culture traits can be used to define culture regions. A culture region is an area in which people have many culture traits in common. For example, the United States and Canada share many culture traits, including language, religion, and political systems. These two countries are part of a larger culture region called North America.

Culture regions can be defined in different ways. Some culture regions are defined by language. For example, people in Quebec, a province in eastern Canada, speak French. Quebec is part of a French-speaking culture region that includes parts of Canada and France.

Other culture regions are defined by religion. For example, the Middle East is home to many Muslims, people who practice the religion of Islam. The Middle East is part of a larger Islamic culture region that includes parts of Africa and Asia.

## Cultural Diversity

The world is home to thousands of different cultures. These cultures can be grouped in many ways.

### Ethnic Groups

One way to group cultures is by ethnic group. An ethnic group is a group of people who share a common language, history, religion, and some physical traits. Ethnic groups often have a strong sense of identity and community.

Many countries are home to multiple ethnic groups. For example, China is home to 56 officially recognized ethnic groups. The largest ethnic group in China is the Han Chinese, who make up about 92 percent of the population. Other ethnic groups in China include the Zhuang, Manchu, Hui, and Tibetans.

### Multicultural Societies

Some countries, like the United States, are home to many different ethnic groups and cultures. These countries are called multicultural societies. A multicultural society is a society that includes people from many different cultural backgrounds.

In multicultural societies, people from different cultures often live side by side. They may maintain their own cultural traditions while also adopting some aspects of the larger society. For example, immigrants to the United States often continue to speak their native language at home while learning English to communicate in the wider society.

## Cultural Change

Cultures are not static; they change over time. Cultural change can happen for many reasons.

### Cultural Diffusion

One way that cultures change is through cultural diffusion. Cultural diffusion is the spread of cultural elements from one society to another. This can happen through trade, migration, conquest, or communication.

For example, pasta is now a staple food in Italian cuisine, but it was originally brought to Italy from China. Similarly, the game of baseball, which is often considered an American pastime, has spread to many countries around the world, including Japan, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic.

### Innovation and Adaptation

Cultures also change through innovation and adaptation. Innovation is the development of new ideas, products, or ways of doing things. Adaptation is the process of changing to fit new circumstances.

For example, the development of the internet has led to significant cultural changes around the world. People now communicate, work, and entertain themselves in ways that were not possible before the internet.

Similarly, cultures often adapt to changes in their environment. For example, as climate change affects agricultural practices, farming cultures may adapt by growing different crops or using new farming techniques.

## Cultural Universals

Despite the diversity of cultures around the world, there are some features that are common to all societies. These are called cultural universals.

### Social Institutions

All societies have social institutions that help the group survive and thrive. These include:

1. **Family**: All societies have some form of family structure, though the specific form varies widely.
2. **Education**: All societies have ways of passing knowledge and skills to the next generation.
3. **Government**: All societies have systems for making and enforcing rules.
4. **Economy**: All societies have ways of producing and distributing goods and services.
5. **Religion**: All societies have beliefs and practices related to the supernatural or the meaning of life.

### Creative Expression

All cultures express themselves creatively through art, music, literature, and other forms of expression. These creative expressions often reflect the values, beliefs, and experiences of the culture.

For example, traditional Japanese art often reflects values of simplicity, harmony with nature, and attention to detail. In contrast, Western art traditions have often emphasized realism, individual expression, and innovation.

### Technology

All societies use technology to help shape and control their environment. Technology includes tools, machines, and techniques that people use to meet their needs.

The specific technologies used by a society are influenced by many factors, including the environment, available resources, and cultural values. For example, societies in cold climates have developed technologies for heating homes and preserving food during winter months.

## Conclusion

Culture is a complex and dynamic aspect of human society. It includes the beliefs, values, and practices that a group of people share. While cultures differ from group to group and change over time, all societies share certain cultural universals. Understanding culture helps us appreciate the diversity of human experience and the common threads that connect all people.
