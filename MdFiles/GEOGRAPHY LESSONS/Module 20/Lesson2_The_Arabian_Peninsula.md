# Lesson 2: The Arabian Peninsula

## The Big Idea
Most countries of the Arabian Peninsula share three main characteristics: Islamic religion and culture, monarchy as a form of government, and valuable oil resources.

## Main Ideas
- Islamic culture and an economy greatly based on oil influence life in Saudi Arabia.
- Most Arabian Peninsula countries other than Iraq and Iran are monarchies influenced by Islamic culture and oil resources.

## Key Terms and Places
- Islam
- Shia
- Sunni
- OPEC
- quota

## If YOU lived there...
You are a financial adviser to the ruler of Oman. Your country has been making quite a bit of money from oil exports. However, you worry that your economy is too dependent on oil. You think Oman's leaders should consider expanding the economy. Oman is a small country, but it has beautiful beaches, historic palaces and mosques, and colorful markets.

**How would you suggest expanding the economy?**

## Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia is by far the largest of the countries of the Arabian Peninsula. It is also a major religious and cultural center and has one of the region's strongest economies.

### People and Customs

Nearly all Saudis are Arab and speak Arabic. Their culture is strongly influenced by Islam, a religion founded around AD 622 in Arabia by Muhammad. It is based on submitting to God (Allah) and on messages Muslims believe Muhammad received from God. These messages are written in the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam.

Nearly all Saudis follow one of two main branches of Islam. Shia Muslims believe that true interpretation of Islamic teaching can only come from certain religious and political leaders called imams. Sunni Muslims believe in the ability of the majority of the community to interpret Islamic teachings. Approximately 85 to 90 percent of Saudi Muslims are Sunni.

Islam influences Saudi Arabia's culture in many ways. In part because Islam requires modesty, Saudi clothing keeps arms and legs covered. Men wear a long, loose shirt and a cotton headdress held in place with a cord. Saudi women wear a black cloak and a veil that covers the face. Saudi law requires women to be accompanied by a male relative when they leave home. Women are not allowed to drive cars.

Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and the location of its two holiest cities, Mecca and Medina. Every year, millions of Muslims from around the world travel to Mecca for the hajj, a religious pilgrimage that all Muslims are expected to make at least once in their lifetime if they are able.

### Government and Economy

Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy, which means the king has complete authority. The king appoints a council of ministers to help him govern. There are no political parties or elections in Saudi Arabia. The country's legal system is based on Islamic law, or Sharia.

Saudi Arabia's economy is dominated by oil. The country has the world's largest proven oil reserves and is the world's largest oil exporter. The oil industry accounts for about 80 percent of government revenue and 45 percent of GDP. Saudi Arabia is a founding member of OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), a group of oil-producing countries that work together to control oil prices and production.

The Saudi government has used its oil wealth to develop the country's infrastructure, education system, and healthcare. However, the economy remains heavily dependent on oil, and the government has been working to diversify into other sectors such as manufacturing, services, and tourism.

Despite its wealth, Saudi Arabia faces economic challenges. Unemployment is high, especially among young people. The country also has a large population of foreign workers, who make up about one-third of the total population and work in jobs ranging from domestic service to professional positions.

## Other Countries of the Arabian Peninsula

The Arabian Peninsula includes several other countries besides Saudi Arabia: Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and Yemen. These countries share many characteristics with Saudi Arabia, including Islamic culture, monarchical governments (except for Yemen), and economies based on oil and natural gas (except for Yemen).

### Kuwait

Kuwait is a small country located at the northwestern corner of the Persian Gulf. It has a constitutional monarchy, with an emir (prince) as head of state and a prime minister as head of government. Kuwait has a partially elected parliament, which gives citizens some voice in government.

Kuwait has one of the world's largest oil reserves, and its economy is heavily dependent on oil exports. The country has a high standard of living, with free education and healthcare for citizens. However, like other Gulf states, Kuwait is working to diversify its economy to reduce dependence on oil.

Kuwait gained international attention in 1990 when it was invaded by Iraq, leading to the Gulf War. A U.S.-led coalition liberated Kuwait in 1991, and the country has since rebuilt its infrastructure and economy.

### Bahrain

Bahrain is an island nation in the Persian Gulf. It is a constitutional monarchy ruled by the Al Khalifa family. Bahrain has a parliament with an elected lower house and an appointed upper house.

Bahrain was the first Gulf state to discover oil, but its reserves are smaller than those of its neighbors. As a result, Bahrain has been more aggressive in diversifying its economy. The country has developed banking and financial services, manufacturing, and tourism. Bahrain is also home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet.

Bahrain has experienced political unrest, particularly during the Arab Spring protests of 2011. The majority of Bahrain's citizens are Shia Muslims, while the ruling family is Sunni, which has contributed to tensions.

### Qatar

Qatar is a small peninsula extending into the Persian Gulf. It is an absolute monarchy ruled by the Al Thani family. Qatar has the world's third-largest natural gas reserves and is the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Qatar has used its wealth to develop its infrastructure, education, and healthcare. The country has also invested heavily in media (Al Jazeera), sports, and cultural institutions. Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the first Middle Eastern country to do so.

Despite its small size, Qatar has become an influential player in regional politics. It has maintained relations with various groups across the political spectrum, sometimes putting it at odds with its neighbors.

### United Arab Emirates (UAE)

The UAE is a federation of seven emirates (principalities), each ruled by a hereditary emir. The seven emirs form the Federal Supreme Council, which elects the president and vice president from among its members.

The UAE has the world's seventh-largest oil reserves and is a major oil exporter. However, it has been successful in diversifying its economy, particularly in Dubai, which has become a global center for trade, finance, tourism, and real estate. Abu Dhabi, the capital, remains more focused on oil production but has also invested in renewable energy and cultural institutions.

The UAE has a high standard of living and has attracted millions of foreign workers and expatriates, who make up about 88 percent of the population. The country is known for its modern architecture, luxury shopping, and ambitious projects such as the Palm Jumeirah artificial island and the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building.

### Oman

Oman is located on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. It is an absolute monarchy ruled by a sultan. Oman has smaller oil reserves than many of its neighbors, which has encouraged it to develop other sectors such as tourism, manufacturing, and agriculture.

Oman has a distinct culture and history. It was historically a maritime power with territories in East Africa. The country has maintained a more traditional character than some of its neighbors, with strict building codes that preserve traditional architectural styles.

Oman has generally pursued a moderate foreign policy, maintaining good relations with both Western countries and Iran. It has often served as a mediator in regional disputes.

### Yemen

Yemen is located at the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula. Unlike its neighbors, Yemen is not a monarchy but a republic, though it has experienced significant political instability. Yemen is also the poorest country in the region, with limited oil resources and a largely agricultural economy.

Yemen has faced numerous challenges, including civil war, terrorism, water scarcity, and food insecurity. Since 2014, the country has been embroiled in a complex civil war involving various factions and regional powers. The conflict has created what the United Nations calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with millions of people facing famine and disease.

## Oil and Regional Politics

Oil has played a crucial role in shaping the politics and economies of the Arabian Peninsula.

### OPEC and Oil Politics

Many countries of the Arabian Peninsula are members of OPEC, which was founded in 1960 to coordinate oil production policies and ensure stable oil prices. OPEC members agree on production quotas, or limits on how much oil each country can produce, to influence global oil prices.

OPEC's influence was demonstrated during the 1973 oil crisis, when Arab oil producers imposed an embargo on countries that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. The embargo led to a fourfold increase in oil prices and highlighted the world's dependence on Middle Eastern oil.

In recent years, OPEC's influence has been challenged by increased oil production in non-OPEC countries, particularly the United States, and by the development of alternative energy sources. However, the organization still plays an important role in global oil markets.

### Regional Cooperation and Conflict

The countries of the Arabian Peninsula have formed regional organizations to promote cooperation. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), established in 1981, includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE, and Oman. The GCC aims to enhance economic, social, and political ties among member states.

Despite these efforts at cooperation, the region has experienced conflicts and tensions. In 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt imposed a blockade on Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and being too close to Iran. The blockade was lifted in 2021.

The region has also been affected by the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which has sectarian dimensions (Sunni versus Shia) and geopolitical aspects. This rivalry has influenced conflicts in Yemen, Syria, and Iraq.

## Challenges and Opportunities

The countries of the Arabian Peninsula face several challenges and opportunities as they look to the future.

### Economic Diversification

Most countries in the region are working to diversify their economies to reduce dependence on oil and gas. This includes developing sectors such as tourism, finance, manufacturing, renewable energy, and technology. The UAE, particularly Dubai, has been most successful in this regard, but other countries are also making efforts.

Economic diversification is driven by several factors:
- Recognition that oil and gas are finite resources
- Volatility of oil prices, which can cause economic instability
- Need to create jobs for growing populations
- Desire to develop knowledge-based economies

### Political Reform

The monarchies of the Arabian Peninsula have traditionally been absolute or near-absolute, with limited political participation. However, there have been some moves toward reform, albeit gradual and limited.

Kuwait has the most developed political system, with a partially elected parliament that has real power. Bahrain also has a parliament, though its powers are more limited. Other countries have consultative councils with varying degrees of influence.

Pressure for political reform comes from both internal and external sources. Internally, educated young people may desire more political rights. Externally, Western allies sometimes encourage democratic reforms, though economic and security interests often take precedence.

### Social Change

The societies of the Arabian Peninsula are experiencing social changes while trying to maintain traditional values and Islamic principles. This balancing act is evident in various areas:

- **Women's Rights**: There have been some improvements in women's rights, such as allowing women to drive in Saudi Arabia (since 2018) and increasing women's participation in the workforce and education. However, gender segregation and male guardianship systems remain in place to varying degrees.

- **Education**: Countries have invested heavily in education, including establishing branches of Western universities. This has increased educational opportunities, particularly for women, who now often outnumber men in higher education.

- **Youth Population**: The region has a young population, with many under the age of 30. This presents both challenges (need for job creation) and opportunities (potential for innovation and economic growth).

## Conclusion

The countries of the Arabian Peninsula share many characteristics, including Islamic culture, monarchical governments (except for Yemen), and economies influenced by oil and gas resources. However, they also have distinct histories, cultures, and approaches to development and governance.

Oil wealth has transformed these countries from poor, underdeveloped regions to modern states with advanced infrastructure and high standards of living (except for Yemen). However, this wealth has also created challenges, including economic dependence on a single resource, rapid social change, and regional rivalries.

As the countries of the Arabian Peninsula look to the future, they face the task of diversifying their economies, addressing political and social pressures, and navigating complex regional and international relationships. Their success in meeting these challenges will shape the region's development in the coming decades.
