## If YOU lived there...
You are a student in Tehran, the capital of Iran. In school, you are taught that the way of life in the West—countries of Europe and the Americas—is bad. News reports and newspapers are filled with negative propaganda about Western countries. Yet you know that some of your friends secretly listen to Western popular music and watch American television programs that they catch using illegal satellite dishes at home. This makes you very curious about Western countries.

## History

The early history of the country we now call Iran includes the Persian Empire and a series of Muslim empires. Iran's recent history includes an Islamic revolution. Today, Iran is an Islamic republic, which limits the rights of many Iranians.

### Persian Empire

Beginning in the 500s BC, the Persian Empire ruled the region around present-day Iran. For centuries, Persia was a great center of art and learning. The Persian Empire was known for its spectacular paintings, carpets, metalwork, and architecture. In the empire's capital, Persepolis, walls and statues throughout the city glittered with gold, silver, and precious jewels.

The Persian Empire was later conquered by several Muslim empires. Muslims converted the Persians to Islam, but most people retained their Persian culture. They built beautiful mosques with colorful tiles and large domes.

### The Safavid Empire

The great era of Arab Muslim expansion lasted until the 1100s. Afterward, three non-Arab Muslim empires emerged: the Ottoman Empire, the Safavid (sah-FAH-vid) Empire, and the Mughal Empire.

The Safavid Empire controlled the area that is now Iran from 1501 to 1722. The Safavids were Shia Muslims, and they made Shia Islam the official religion of their empire. This distinguished them from the neighboring Ottoman Empire, which was Sunni Muslim. The rivalry between these two empires reflected the division between Shia and Sunni Islam that continues today.

Under the Safavids, Persian culture flourished. The empire's rulers built magnificent mosques, palaces, and public squares. The city of Esfahan (es-fah-HAHN), the Safavid capital, became one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The Safavids also supported the arts, including painting, calligraphy, and carpet weaving.

### Modern Iran

In the 1800s and early 1900s, Iran (still called Persia until 1935) came under increasing European influence. Britain and Russia competed for control of the region, and Iran's rulers granted concessions to foreign companies, particularly for oil exploration.

In 1921, an army officer named Reza Khan seized power in a coup. He established the Pahlavi dynasty and took the title of shah, or king. Reza Shah, as he was known, modernized Iran's infrastructure, education system, and military. He also reduced the influence of religious leaders and promoted secularization.

During World War II, Britain and the Soviet Union occupied Iran because of its strategic location and oil resources. Reza Shah, who had sympathized with Nazi Germany, was forced to abdicate in favor of his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

Mohammad Reza Shah continued his father's modernization policies. With support from the United States, he implemented a series of reforms known as the White Revolution, which included land reform, women's suffrage, and industrialization. However, these reforms were controversial, and the shah's autocratic rule, along with growing inequality and Western cultural influence, led to increasing opposition.

### The Islamic Revolution

In the 1970s, opposition to the shah grew among various groups, including religious conservatives, leftists, and nationalists. The most influential opposition leader was Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a Shia cleric who had been exiled by the shah.

In 1978, protests against the shah erupted across Iran. The movement gained momentum, and in January 1979, the shah fled the country. Ayatollah Khomeini returned from exile in February 1979, and the monarchy was officially abolished. This event, known as the Islamic Revolution, transformed Iran from a monarchy to an Islamic republic.

The new government established a political system based on Islamic principles, with Ayatollah Khomeini as the Supreme Leader. The constitution created a complex system with both elected and unelected institutions, but ultimate authority rested with the Supreme Leader and other religious figures.

Shortly after the revolution, Iranian students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. This hostage crisis led to a break in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States that continues to this day.

### Iran-Iraq War

In September 1980, Iraq, under Saddam Hussein, invaded Iran, beginning the Iran-Iraq War. The war lasted eight years and resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides. Despite Iraq's initial advantages, Iran was able to repel the invasion and even counter-attack into Iraqi territory.

The war had a profound impact on Iranian society and politics. It strengthened the revolutionary government's hold on power and fostered a sense of national unity against an external threat. However, it also caused immense human suffering and economic damage.

## Government and Society

Iran today is an Islamic republic with a complex political system that combines elements of theocracy and democracy.

### Political System

Iran's political system is based on the concept of velayat-e faqih, or guardianship of the Islamic jurist. According to this principle, a qualified religious scholar should have authority over the government to ensure that it operates according to Islamic principles.

The Supreme Leader is the highest authority in Iran. He is appointed by the Assembly of Experts, a body of religious scholars elected by the public. The Supreme Leader controls the armed forces, security services, and judiciary, and has final say on major policy decisions.

The president is the head of government and is elected by popular vote for a four-year term. However, the president's power is limited by the Supreme Leader and other unelected institutions. All presidential candidates must be approved by the Guardian Council, a body of religious scholars and jurists, half of whom are appointed by the Supreme Leader.

Iran has a unicameral legislature called the Islamic Consultative Assembly, or Majlis. Its members are elected by popular vote, but again, all candidates must be approved by the Guardian Council.

This system creates a tension between democratic and theocratic elements. While Iranians can vote in elections, their choices are limited to candidates deemed acceptable by the religious establishment.

### Society and Daily Life

Iranian society is diverse, with various ethnic groups including Persians (the majority), Azeris, Kurds, Arabs, and others. The official language is Persian (Farsi), but other languages are also spoken.

Islam, particularly Shia Islam, plays a central role in Iranian society. Religious observances, such as daily prayers and fasting during Ramadan, are important parts of daily life for many Iranians. Islamic principles are also reflected in laws and social norms.

Women in Iran face significant legal and social restrictions. They are required to wear hijab (modest Islamic dress) in public, and there are limitations on their rights in areas such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance. However, Iranian women have made progress in education and some professions, and they often find ways to assert their agency within the constraints of the system.

Despite the government's efforts to promote Islamic values and restrict Western influence, many Iranians, particularly the younger generation, are interested in global culture and technology. There is a vibrant underground scene for music, art, and literature that sometimes pushes the boundaries of what is officially permitted.

### Economy

Iran has the second-largest economy in the Middle East, after Saudi Arabia. It has significant natural resources, including the world's second-largest natural gas reserves and the fourth-largest proven oil reserves. Oil and gas exports are the main source of government revenue and foreign exchange.

However, Iran's economy faces significant challenges. International sanctions, imposed in response to Iran's nuclear program and other issues, have limited its access to global markets and financial systems. This has contributed to high inflation, unemployment, and other economic problems.

The government plays a dominant role in the economy, with many industries controlled by state-owned enterprises or foundations linked to the religious establishment. This has led to inefficiencies and corruption. There is also a large informal economy and black market, particularly for goods restricted by sanctions.

Despite these challenges, Iran has a relatively diversified economy compared to some other oil-producing countries in the region. It has significant manufacturing, agriculture, and service sectors, and a well-educated workforce.

## International Relations

Iran's relations with the international community are complex and often tense, particularly with Western countries.

### Nuclear Program

Iran's nuclear program has been a major source of international concern and tension. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, such as generating electricity and medical research. However, many countries, particularly the United States and Israel, have suspected that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

In 2015, Iran reached an agreement with the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China (the P5+1) known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or the Iran nuclear deal. Under this agreement, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities and allow international inspections in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.

However, in 2018, the United States under President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran. In response, Iran began to exceed some of the limits set by the agreement. Efforts to revive the deal have been ongoing but have faced significant challenges.

### Regional Influence

Iran is a significant regional power in the Middle East. It has sought to extend its influence through various means, including support for allied groups and governments in countries such as Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen.

Iran's main regional rival is Saudi Arabia, and the two countries are engaged in what some analysts call a "cold war" for regional influence. This rivalry has sectarian dimensions (Shia Iran versus Sunni Saudi Arabia) and geopolitical aspects.

Iran has close relations with groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and various Shia militias in Iraq. It has also supported the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and the Houthi movement in Yemen. These relationships have been a source of concern for other countries in the region and for Western powers.

### Relations with the United States

Relations between Iran and the United States have been hostile since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the subsequent hostage crisis. The United States has imposed various sanctions on Iran over the years, citing concerns about Iran's nuclear program, support for groups designated as terrorist organizations, and human rights abuses.

There have been periods of limited engagement, such as during the negotiations for the JCPOA. However, fundamental differences and mutual distrust have prevented a normalization of relations. The United States maintains that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism and a destabilizing force in the region, while Iran views the United States as an imperialist power seeking to undermine its sovereignty and Islamic system.

## Culture and Heritage

Iran has a rich cultural heritage that spans thousands of years, from the ancient Persian Empire to the present day.

### Literature and Art

Persian literature has a long and distinguished history. The Shahnameh, or Book of Kings, written by the poet Ferdowsi around 1000 AD, is a national epic that tells the mythical and historical past of Persia. Other renowned Persian poets include Rumi, Hafez, and Omar Khayyam, whose works are still widely read and celebrated.

Iranian visual arts include painting, calligraphy, miniature painting, and carpet weaving. Persian carpets are known worldwide for their intricate designs and high quality. Iranian architecture is also notable, with its domes, arches, and colorful tile work, as seen in famous buildings such as the Shah Mosque in Esfahan.

Iranian cinema has gained international recognition, with directors such as Abbas Kiarostami, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, and Asghar Farhadi winning awards at major film festivals. Iranian films often deal with social issues and human relationships, using subtle storytelling techniques to navigate censorship.

### Cultural Challenges

The Islamic Republic has imposed various restrictions on cultural expression. Music, film, literature, and other arts are subject to censorship, and works deemed un-Islamic or politically subversive may be banned. Western cultural influences are particularly restricted, though many Iranians access foreign media through satellite television and the internet, despite government efforts to block such access.

Despite these restrictions, Iranian culture continues to thrive, both within the official boundaries and in underground or exile communities. Many Iranian artists and intellectuals find creative ways to express themselves while navigating the constraints of the system.

## Challenges and Opportunities

Iran faces several challenges as it moves forward, but it also has opportunities for development and change.

### Political and Social Tensions

There are significant political and social tensions within Iran. The country has experienced periodic protests and unrest, such as the Green Movement in 2009 (following a disputed presidential election) and protests in 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 (triggered by economic grievances but expanding to include political demands).

These protests reflect divisions within Iranian society. While the government maintains support from a significant portion of the population, particularly in rural and conservative areas, there is also substantial dissatisfaction, especially among urban, educated, and younger Iranians who desire greater political freedom and social openness.

The government has responded to protests with a combination of repression and limited reforms. However, fundamental political change would require addressing the tension between the theocratic and democratic elements of the system.

### Economic Challenges

Iran's economy faces significant challenges, including:

- **Sanctions**: International sanctions have limited Iran's ability to export oil, access global financial systems, and import certain goods and technologies.

- **Inflation and Unemployment**: Iran has experienced high inflation and unemployment, particularly among young people.

- **Dependence on Oil**: Despite efforts at diversification, the economy remains heavily dependent on oil exports, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices.

- **State Dominance**: The state's dominant role in the economy, along with corruption and inefficiency, has hindered private sector development.

Addressing these challenges would require a combination of internal reforms and improved international relations to reduce sanctions.

### Environmental Issues

Iran faces serious environmental challenges, including water scarcity, air pollution, and land degradation. Climate change is exacerbating these problems, particularly water scarcity, which could have significant social and economic impacts.

Lake Urmia, once one of the largest salt lakes in the world, has shrunk dramatically due to dam construction, water diversion for agriculture, and climate change. This environmental disaster has affected the local ecosystem and economy.

Air pollution in Tehran and other major cities is among the worst in the world, causing significant health problems. The pollution is caused by factors such as vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and geographical features that trap pollutants.

## Conclusion

Iran is a country with a rich history and culture, from the ancient Persian Empire to the Islamic Republic of today. Its political system combines theocratic and democratic elements, with ultimate authority resting with religious leaders. This system has provided stability but has also limited political freedom and social openness.

Economically, Iran has significant resources and potential, but faces challenges from international sanctions, state dominance of the economy, and dependence on oil exports. Its international relations are complex, with tensions with Western countries and regional rivalries, particularly with Saudi Arabia.

Despite these challenges, Iran has a well-educated population, a relatively diversified economy compared to some of its neighbors, and a rich cultural heritage. The future of Iran will depend on how it navigates its internal political and social tensions, addresses its economic challenges, and manages its relations with the international community.
