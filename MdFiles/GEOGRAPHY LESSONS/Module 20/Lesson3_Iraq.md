## If YOU lived there...
You are a student in a school in Iraq's capital, Baghdad. During the war, your school and its library were badly damaged. Since then, you and your friends have had few books to read. Now your teachers and others are organizing a project to rebuild your library. They want to include books from all countries of the world as well as computers so students can use the Internet.

## History

Did you know that the world's first civilization was located in Iraq? Thousands of years ago, people known as Sumerians settled in Mesopotamiaâ€”a region that is part of Iraq today. The country's recent history includes wars and a corrupt leader.

### Early Civilization

Throughout Mesopotamia's history, different cultures and empires conquered the region. As you can see on the map, the Sumerians settled in southern Mesopotamia. By about 3000 BC the Sumerians built the world's first-known cities there. The Persians then conquered Mesopotamia in the 500s BC. By 331 BC Alexander the Great made it part of his empire. In the AD 600s Arabs conquered Mesopotamia, and the people gradually converted to Islam.

In the 1500s Mesopotamia became part of the Ottoman Empire. During World War I, Great Britain took over the region. The British set up the kingdom of Iraq in 1932 and placed a pro-British ruler in power. In the 1950s a group of Iraqi army officers overthrew this government.

### Saddam Takes Power

In 1968, after several more changes in Iraq's government, the Ba'ath (bahth) Party took power. In 1979 a Ba'ath leader named Saddam Hussein became Iraq's president. Saddam Hussein was a harsh ruler. He controlled the media and banned political opposition. His government killed thousands of Iraqis who opposed him.

In 1980 Iraq invaded neighboring Iran. The Iran-Iraq War lasted until 1988 and ended in a stalemate. The war severely damaged Iraq's economy and infrastructure.

In 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, a small, oil-rich country to the south. In response, the United States led a coalition of countries that forced Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait in the Gulf War of 1991. After the war, the United Nations imposed an embargo, or ban on trade, against Iraq. The embargo was intended to pressure Iraq to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and to pay for war damages. However, it also caused hardship for ordinary Iraqis, as food, medicine, and other essential goods became scarce.

### Recent Conflict

In 2003, the United States and its allies invaded Iraq, claiming that Saddam Hussein's government possessed weapons of mass destruction and had ties to terrorist groups. No such weapons were found, but the invasion led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government. Saddam was captured, tried by an Iraqi court, and executed in 2006.

After the invasion, a new Iraqi government was established, but the country faced numerous challenges. Sectarian violence erupted between Sunni and Shia Muslims. Insurgent groups, including Al-Qaeda in Iraq (which later evolved into ISIS), fought against U.S. forces and the new Iraqi government. The conflict resulted in hundreds of thousands of Iraqi deaths and displaced millions more.

U.S. combat troops withdrew from Iraq in 2011, but violence continued. In 2014, ISIS seized control of large parts of northern and western Iraq, including Mosul, the country's second-largest city. Iraqi forces, with support from the United States and other countries, gradually recaptured territory from ISIS. By 2017, the Iraqi government declared victory over ISIS, though the group continued to carry out attacks.

## People and Culture

Iraq has a rich and diverse cultural heritage shaped by its long history and the many civilizations that have flourished there.

### Population

Iraq has a population of about 40 million people. The majority (75-80%) are Arabs, but the country is also home to significant minority groups, including Kurds (15-20%), Turkmen, Assyrians, and others.

Iraq's population is predominantly Muslim, with Shia Muslims making up about 60-65% and Sunni Muslims about 30-35%. There are also small communities of Christians, Yazidis, Mandaeans, and other religious groups.

The Kurdish population is concentrated in the northeastern part of the country, in a semi-autonomous region known as Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurds have their own language and culture, and the Kurdish region has its own government, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).

### Language and Religion

Arabic is the official language of Iraq and is spoken by the majority of the population. Kurdish is recognized as an official language in the Kurdish region. Other languages spoken in Iraq include Turkmen, Assyrian, and Armenian.

Islam is the official religion of Iraq and plays a significant role in Iraqi culture and society. The split between Shia and Sunni Muslims has been a source of tension and conflict in Iraq's recent history. Under Saddam Hussein's rule, the Sunni minority held most positions of power, while the Shia majority was often marginalized. After the 2003 invasion, this power dynamic shifted, leading to sectarian violence.

### Cultural Heritage

Iraq has a rich cultural heritage that spans thousands of years. It is often called the "cradle of civilization" because it was home to some of the world's earliest civilizations, including the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians.

These ancient civilizations made significant contributions to human knowledge and culture. The Sumerians invented the world's first writing system, cuneiform, around 3200 BC. They also developed mathematics, astronomy, and literature. The Code of Hammurabi, one of the earliest written legal codes, was created in Babylon around 1750 BC.

Iraq's cultural heritage includes numerous archaeological sites, such as the ancient city of Babylon, the ziggurat at Ur, and the Assyrian capital of Nineveh. Many artifacts from these sites are housed in the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad, though the museum was looted during the chaos following the 2003 invasion.

### Arts and Literature

Iraq has a strong tradition of literature, music, and visual arts. Poetry is particularly important in Iraqi culture, with a tradition dating back to pre-Islamic times. Modern Iraqi literature includes works in both Arabic and Kurdish.

Iraqi music combines elements of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish traditions. Traditional instruments include the oud (a stringed instrument similar to a lute), the santur (a type of hammered dulcimer), and various drums and percussion instruments.

Visual arts in Iraq include calligraphy, painting, and sculpture. Modern Iraqi art often reflects the country's complex history and political situation, addressing themes of identity, conflict, and resilience.

## Iraq Today

Iraq faces numerous challenges as it works to rebuild after years of conflict. These challenges include political instability, economic reconstruction, and security concerns.

### Government and Politics

Iraq is a federal parliamentary republic. The 2005 constitution established a system of government with a president as head of state, a prime minister as head of government, and a unicameral legislature called the Council of Representatives.

The political system is designed to ensure representation for Iraq's various ethnic and religious groups. However, this has sometimes led to political deadlock, as different factions struggle to form coalitions and agree on policies.

Corruption remains a significant problem in Iraqi politics. Transparency International consistently ranks Iraq among the most corrupt countries in the world. This corruption undermines public trust in government institutions and hinders economic development.

Iraq also faces challenges related to federalism and the status of disputed territories, particularly in relation to the Kurdish region. The Kurdish Regional Government has sought greater autonomy, and in 2017 held a referendum on independence, which was rejected by the Iraqi government and international community.

### Economy

Iraq has significant economic potential, particularly due to its vast oil reserves, which are among the largest in the world. Oil accounts for about 90% of government revenue and 80% of foreign exchange earnings.

However, the Iraqi economy faces numerous challenges:

- **Infrastructure Damage**: Years of conflict have damaged infrastructure, including oil facilities, power plants, water treatment systems, and transportation networks.

- **Dependence on Oil**: The economy's heavy dependence on oil makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices.

- **Unemployment**: Unemployment is high, particularly among young people. The public sector is the largest employer, but it cannot absorb all job seekers.

- **Corruption and Inefficiency**: Corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency hinder economic development and discourage foreign investment.

- **Security Concerns**: Ongoing security concerns in some areas make it difficult to attract investment and develop the economy.

Despite these challenges, there have been efforts to rebuild and diversify the Iraqi economy. The government has worked with international organizations and foreign governments to reconstruct infrastructure, develop the private sector, and improve governance.

### Security and Stability

Security remains a concern in Iraq, though the situation has improved since the height of the conflict. The defeat of ISIS in 2017 was a significant milestone, but the group continues to carry out attacks in some areas.

Sectarian tensions persist, though they are less acute than during the worst periods of violence. Relations between the central government and the Kurdish region have improved somewhat since the 2017 independence referendum crisis, but tensions remain.

Iraq is also affected by regional geopolitics, particularly the rivalry between the United States and Iran. Both countries have significant influence in Iraq, and their competition for influence can complicate Iraq's political and security situation.

### Humanitarian Situation

Years of conflict have had a severe humanitarian impact on Iraq. According to the United Nations, about 4.1 million Iraqis need humanitarian assistance. This includes internally displaced persons (IDPs) who fled their homes due to conflict, as well as vulnerable host communities.

Many Iraqis lack access to basic services such as clean water, healthcare, and education. Infrastructure in conflict-affected areas has been severely damaged, and reconstruction efforts are ongoing but face funding shortages and other challenges.

Mental health is also a significant concern, as many Iraqis have experienced trauma due to conflict, displacement, and loss. However, mental health services are limited, particularly in rural and conflict-affected areas.

## Rebuilding Efforts

Despite the challenges it faces, Iraq has made progress in rebuilding after years of conflict. These efforts include political reconciliation, economic reconstruction, and cultural preservation.

### Political Reconciliation

Efforts have been made to promote political reconciliation among Iraq's various ethnic and religious groups. The constitution guarantees representation for different groups, and there have been attempts to form inclusive governments.

However, political reconciliation remains a work in progress. Sectarian tensions persist, and political parties often align along ethnic or religious lines. Building a stable, inclusive political system will require ongoing effort and commitment from Iraqi leaders and citizens.

### Economic Reconstruction

Economic reconstruction is a priority for Iraq. The government, with support from international organizations and foreign governments, has invested in rebuilding infrastructure, developing the oil sector, and improving public services.

There have also been efforts to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on oil. This includes developing agriculture, manufacturing, and services. However, progress has been slow due to various challenges, including corruption, security concerns, and bureaucratic inefficiency.

### Cultural Preservation

Iraq has worked to preserve and restore its rich cultural heritage, which has been damaged by conflict and looting. The National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad, which was looted in 2003, has been partially restored and reopened. Efforts have also been made to protect and restore archaeological sites, though many remain at risk.

International organizations such as UNESCO have supported these efforts, recognizing the global significance of Iraq's cultural heritage. However, much work remains to be done to fully document, protect, and restore Iraq's cultural treasures.

## Conclusion

Iraq is a country with a rich history and cultural heritage, from the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia to the diverse communities of today. However, it has faced numerous challenges in recent decades, including authoritarian rule, international sanctions, and conflict.

Today, Iraq is working to rebuild and create a stable, prosperous future. This involves addressing political divisions, reconstructing the economy, improving security, and preserving cultural heritage. While the challenges are significant, Iraq has resources and resilience that can support its recovery and development.

The international community has a role to play in supporting Iraq's rebuilding efforts, recognizing both the country's sovereignty and its need for assistance. With effective leadership, inclusive governance, and sustainable development, Iraq has the potential to overcome its recent difficulties and build on its rich heritage to create a better future for its people.
