# Lesson 2: Political Change in Europe

## The Big Idea
Ideas of the Enlightenment inspired revolutions and new governments in Europe.

## Main Ideas
- Enlightenment thinkers developed new ideas about government and society.
- The French Revolution overthrew the monarchy and established a republic based on the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity.
- Napoleon Bonaparte built a French empire but was ultimately defeated.
- Nationalism and the desire for democracy led to revolutions across Europe in the 1800s.

## If YOU lived there...
You live in a village in northern France in the 1700s. Your father is a baker, and your mother is a seamstress. Like most people in your village, your family struggles to survive. You pay high taxes to the king, the nobles, and the church. Yet these wealthy people pay no taxes at all. Now people are talking about revolution and the rights of ordinary citizens.

**Would you join a revolution against the king?**

## The Enlightenment

During the 1700s, a new intellectual movement called the **Enlightenment** spread across Europe. Building on the Scientific Revolution, Enlightenment thinkers believed that reason and logic could improve society. They questioned traditional authority and developed new ideas about government, economics, and human rights.

### Enlightenment Thinkers

Several key philosophers shaped Enlightenment thought:

**John Locke** (1632-1704), an English philosopher, argued that people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. He believed that government exists to protect these rights. If a government fails to do so, the people have the right to overthrow it. Locke's ideas about natural rights and the social contract—an agreement between rulers and the ruled—influenced later revolutions.

**Baron de Montesquieu** (1689-1755), a French philosopher, studied different forms of government. In his book *The Spirit of the Laws*, he proposed the separation of powers into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. He believed this separation would prevent any one person or group from gaining too much power.

**Voltaire** (1694-1778), another French philosopher, was a strong advocate for freedom of speech and religion. He criticized the Catholic Church and absolute monarchy. Voltaire's witty and satirical writings made his ideas popular throughout Europe.

**Jean-Jacques Rousseau** (1712-1778) argued that government should represent the "general will" of the people. In his book *The Social Contract*, he wrote, "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains." Rousseau believed that people are naturally good but are corrupted by society.

**Adam Smith** (1723-1790), a Scottish economist, developed the theory of free-market capitalism. In his book *The Wealth of Nations*, he argued that the economy works best when people are free to pursue their own economic interests with minimal government interference.

### Spread of Enlightenment Ideas

Enlightenment ideas spread through:

- **Books and pamphlets**: Philosophers published their ideas in books that were read by the educated classes.
- **Salons**: Wealthy women hosted gatherings where philosophers and others discussed new ideas.
- **Coffeehouses**: These became centers for political discussion among the middle class.
- **Encyclopedia**: Denis Diderot published a 28-volume Encyclopedia that spread Enlightenment ideas.

The Enlightenment had a profound impact on society. It challenged traditional authority, promoted religious tolerance, and inspired political reform. Most importantly, it provided the intellectual foundation for the revolutions that followed.

## The French Revolution

In 1789, France experienced one of history's most significant political upheavals—the French Revolution. Inspired by Enlightenment ideas and the American Revolution, the French people overthrew their monarchy and established a republic based on the principles of "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity."

### Causes of the Revolution

Several factors contributed to the French Revolution:

1. **Social inequality**: French society was divided into three estates—the clergy (First Estate), the nobility (Second Estate), and everyone else (Third Estate). The First and Second Estates had many privileges, including exemption from most taxes, while the Third Estate bore the tax burden despite having the least wealth.

2. **Economic crisis**: France faced severe economic problems, including poor harvests, high food prices, and massive government debt from wars, including support for the American Revolution.

3. **Weak leadership**: King Louis XVI was indecisive and failed to address France's problems. His wife, Marie Antoinette, was unpopular and seen as extravagant.

4. **Enlightenment ideas**: The spread of ideas about natural rights, liberty, and equality made people question the absolute monarchy and the privileges of the nobility and clergy.

### The Revolution Begins

In May 1789, Louis XVI called a meeting of the Estates-General, an assembly of representatives from all three estates, to address the financial crisis. The Third Estate, representing 98 percent of the population but having only one vote (the same as each of the other estates), demanded more power.

When their demands were rejected, representatives of the Third Estate formed the National Assembly and vowed to write a constitution for France. On July 14, 1789, Parisian citizens stormed the Bastille, a royal prison, marking the beginning of the revolution.

### Phases of the Revolution

The French Revolution went through several phases:

1. **Constitutional Monarchy (1789-1792)**:
   - The National Assembly abolished feudal privileges and adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which stated that "men are born and remain free and equal in rights."
   - A new constitution established a limited monarchy with a legislative assembly.
   - King Louis XVI reluctantly accepted these changes but later tried to flee the country, damaging his credibility.

2. **The Republic and the Reign of Terror (1792-1794)**:
   - War with Austria and Prussia threatened the revolution.
   - Radicals called Jacobins, led by Maximilien Robespierre, took control of the government.
   - The monarchy was abolished, and Louis XVI was executed in January 1793.
   - The Reign of Terror began, during which thousands of "enemies of the revolution" were executed by guillotine.
   - Eventually, Robespierre himself was executed, ending the Terror.

3. **The Directory (1795-1799)**:
   - A five-member Directory governed France.
   - This period was marked by corruption and instability.
   - The government faced threats from both royalists who wanted to restore the monarchy and radicals who wanted more reforms.

## Napoleon Bonaparte

In 1799, a military leader named Napoleon Bonaparte seized power in France, ending the French Revolution. Napoleon would go on to dominate European affairs for the next 15 years.

### Napoleon's Rise to Power

Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica in 1769. He joined the French army and rose quickly through the ranks during the revolutionary wars. His military victories in Italy and Egypt made him a national hero.

In November 1799, Napoleon staged a coup d'état, overthrowing the Directory and establishing the Consulate with himself as First Consul. In 1804, he crowned himself Emperor of the French.

### Napoleon's Domestic Reforms

As ruler of France, Napoleon implemented many important reforms:

- **Napoleonic Code**: A comprehensive legal system that incorporated many Enlightenment principles, including equality before the law and freedom of religion.
- **Educational system**: Napoleon established a national system of public education.
- **Financial reforms**: He created the Bank of France and stabilized the currency.
- **Administrative reforms**: Napoleon centralized the government, appointing officials to administer the country efficiently.

These reforms modernized France and spread Enlightenment principles throughout Europe. Many of Napoleon's institutions and legal codes remain in place today.

### Napoleon's Empire

Through a series of brilliant military campaigns, Napoleon conquered much of Europe. By 1812, the French Empire included the Netherlands, parts of Italy and Germany, and Poland. Napoleon also controlled Spain and had alliances with Austria, Prussia, and Russia.

In the territories he controlled, Napoleon:
- Abolished feudalism
- Introduced the Napoleonic Code
- Promoted religious tolerance
- Standardized weights and measures
- Built roads and other infrastructure

However, Napoleon's rule was also oppressive. He censored the press, used secret police to silence opposition, and demanded high taxes and military service from conquered peoples.

### Napoleon's Downfall

Several factors led to Napoleon's defeat:

1. **Continental System**: Napoleon's attempt to blockade British goods from Europe hurt the economies of his own empire and allies.

2. **Nationalism**: As French control spread, conquered peoples developed a sense of national identity and resistance to foreign rule.

3. **Invasion of Russia**: In 1812, Napoleon invaded Russia with over 600,000 troops. The Russians retreated, drawing the French deep into Russia. When Napoleon reached Moscow, he found it abandoned and burning. Facing the Russian winter without adequate supplies, Napoleon was forced to retreat. Only about 100,000 of his soldiers survived.

4. **Coalition against France**: Britain, Russia, Prussia, and Austria formed an alliance against Napoleon and defeated his forces at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813.

5. **Final defeat**: After briefly being exiled to the island of Elba, Napoleon escaped and returned to power in France for the "Hundred Days." He was finally defeated by British and Prussian forces at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and exiled to the remote island of St. Helena, where he died in 1821.

## Nationalism and Revolution

After Napoleon's defeat, European leaders met at the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) to restore stability and order. They redrew the map of Europe and restored many monarchs to their thrones. However, the ideas of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution—liberty, equality, and nationalism—continued to inspire people throughout Europe.

### The Rise of Nationalism

**Nationalism** is the belief that people who share a common language, history, and culture should have their own independent country. This idea gained strength in the 1800s and led to significant changes in Europe.

Nationalism inspired people to:
- Seek independence from foreign rulers
- Unify fragmented regions into nation-states
- Preserve and promote their cultural identity

### Revolutions of 1848

In 1848, a wave of revolutions swept across Europe. These uprisings were driven by:
- Demands for democratic reforms
- Nationalist aspirations
- Economic hardship
- Desire for constitutional government

Revolutions broke out in France, the German states, the Italian states, and the Austrian Empire. Although most of these revolutions ultimately failed, they demonstrated the power of nationalist and democratic ideas.

### Unification of Italy and Germany

Nationalism eventually led to the creation of two major new European powers:

**Italy**: Before 1861, Italy was divided into several states, some under foreign control. Giuseppe Garibaldi led a military campaign in southern Italy, while Count Camillo di Cavour used diplomacy to unite the north. By 1870, Italy was unified under King Victor Emmanuel II.

**Germany**: Otto von Bismarck, the prime minister of Prussia, led the unification of Germany through a series of wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. In 1871, the German Empire was proclaimed, with Prussian King Wilhelm I as emperor.

### Legacy of Nationalism

Nationalism had both positive and negative effects:
- It led to the creation of new nation-states and the spread of democratic ideas.
- It promoted cultural identity and pride.
- It sometimes led to conflicts between nations competing for power and territory.
- It contributed to the tensions that would eventually lead to World War I.
