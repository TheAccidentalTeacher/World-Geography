# Lesson 1: Science and Exploration

## The Big Idea
New inventions and knowledge led to European exploration and empires around the world.

## Main Ideas
- During the Scientific Revolution, discoveries and inventions expanded knowledge and changed life in Europe.
- In the 1400s and 1500s, Europeans led voyages of discovery and exploration.
- As Europeans discovered new lands, they built empires around the world.

## If YOU lived there...
You are an adviser to a European king in the 1500s. The rulers of several other countries have sent explorers to search for new trade routes. Your king does not want to fall behind. Now a young sea captain has come to the royal court with a daring plan. The king is interested, but funding such a voyage could be costly.

**What will you advise the king to do?**

## The Scientific Revolution

Can you imagine what your life would be like without science? Think of all the things that science has provided in our daily lives—from medicines to computers to space travel. Science has changed the way we understand our world and the way we live in it.

### A New View of Science

Before the 1500s most educated people who studied the world relied on authorities such as ancient Greek writers and church officials. People thought these authorities could tell them all they needed to know. Europeans had little need for science.

Between about 1540 and 1700, though, European views about how to study the world changed. This widespread change in views was part of the **Scientific Revolution**, the series of events that led to the birth of modern science. People began placing more importance on what they observed and experienced than on what authorities said. They began to use experiments and mathematics to discover the laws that govern nature.

### Scientific Discoveries

The Scientific Revolution began with the work of Nicolaus Copernicus (koh-PUR-nuh-kuhs), a Polish astronomer. For centuries, Europeans had believed that Earth was the center of the universe. In 1543 Copernicus published a book suggesting that Earth and the other planets revolve around the sun. This idea is called the heliocentric theory. (Helio comes from the Greek word for "sun.")

Many people, including church leaders, rejected Copernicus's theory. They thought it contradicted the Bible. But other scientists built on his work. In the early 1600s, Italian scientist Galileo Galilei (gal-uh-LAY-oh gal-uh-LAY) used a telescope to study the planets. His observations supported the heliocentric theory. Church officials ordered Galileo to take back his statements supporting Copernicus. When he refused, they put him under house arrest.

The English scientist Isaac Newton made perhaps the most important breakthrough of the Scientific Revolution. In 1687 he published a book that explained the law of gravity. This law explains why objects fall to the ground when dropped and why planets orbit the sun. Newton's discoveries tied together the work of earlier scientists and created a new understanding of how the universe works.

### New Inventions and Knowledge

The Scientific Revolution led to many new inventions and discoveries that changed life in Europe. For example, Anton van Leeuwenhoek (LAY-vuhn-hook) invented a microscope powerful enough to see bacteria. Evangelista Torricelli (tawr-ee-CHEL-ee) invented the barometer, which measures air pressure and helps predict weather changes. Advances in medicine included the discovery of how blood circulates through the body.

The Scientific Revolution also changed the way people thought. Scientists began to think that the world operated according to natural laws. They believed that humans could discover these laws through observation and experimentation. This approach to gaining knowledge is called the scientific method. It involves:

1. Observing something that needs explaining
2. Creating a hypothesis, or possible explanation
3. Testing the hypothesis through experiments
4. Analyzing the results of the experiments
5. Drawing conclusions

The scientific method became the standard way of investigating the world. It led to many more discoveries and inventions in the years to come.

## European Exploration

While the Scientific Revolution was changing how Europeans thought about the world, exploration was changing what they knew about it. In the 1400s and 1500s, European explorers sailed to distant lands in search of wealth, glory, and knowledge.

### Motives for Exploration

Several factors led Europeans to explore new lands:

1. **Economic motives**: Europeans wanted to find new trade routes to Asia to obtain valuable goods like silk and spices. The traditional land routes had become dangerous and expensive after the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople in 1453.

2. **Religious motives**: Many explorers wanted to spread Christianity to new lands.

3. **Desire for glory**: Explorers and their royal sponsors wanted the fame and power that would come from claiming new lands.

4. **Curiosity**: The Renaissance spirit of inquiry led many Europeans to seek knowledge about distant places.

### Technology and Exploration

New technologies made long ocean voyages possible:

- **Improved ships**: The caravel was a new type of ship that was faster and more maneuverable than earlier vessels.
- **Better navigation tools**: The astrolabe and the magnetic compass helped sailors determine their location at sea.
- **More accurate maps**: As explorers returned with information about new lands, mapmakers created more detailed and accurate maps.

### Portuguese Exploration

Portugal led the way in European exploration. Prince Henry the Navigator established a school for sailors and sponsored many voyages along the west coast of Africa. Portuguese explorers were seeking a sea route to Asia by sailing around Africa.

In 1488, Bartolomeu Dias rounded the southern tip of Africa, which became known as the Cape of Good Hope. Ten years later, Vasco da Gama followed this route all the way to India. Portugal established trading posts along the coasts of Africa and Asia, creating a vast trading empire.

### Spanish Exploration

Spain soon joined the race for exploration and empire. In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed west across the Atlantic Ocean, hoping to reach Asia. Instead, he landed on islands in the Caribbean, which he thought were the East Indies. Columbus made three more voyages to the Americas, still believing he had reached Asia.

Other explorers soon realized that Columbus had found a "New World." In 1519, Ferdinand Magellan set out to sail around the world. Although Magellan died during the journey, one of his ships completed the voyage in 1522, proving that the world was round and that the oceans were connected.

Spain claimed vast territories in the Americas. Conquistadors (conquerors) like Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro defeated powerful Native American empires—the Aztecs in Mexico and the Incas in Peru. Spain established a huge colonial empire that lasted for more than 300 years.

### Other European Powers

Other European nations soon joined in exploration and colonization:

- **England** sent John Cabot to explore North America in 1497 and later established colonies along the Atlantic coast.
- **France** explored the St. Lawrence River and the Mississippi River valley, claiming territory in what is now Canada and the central United States.
- **The Netherlands** established trading posts in Asia and colonies in the Americas.

## Impact of European Exploration

European exploration had far-reaching consequences for both Europe and the lands they discovered.

### The Columbian Exchange

The voyages of Columbus began what historians call the **Columbian Exchange**—the transfer of plants, animals, diseases, and people between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.

From the Americas to Europe went:
- New foods like corn, potatoes, tomatoes, and chocolate
- Gold and silver
- New plants like tobacco

From Europe to the Americas went:
- Horses, cattle, pigs, and sheep
- Wheat, sugar, and coffee
- Diseases like smallpox and measles

The Columbian Exchange dramatically changed both worlds. New American foods helped feed Europe's growing population. European diseases devastated Native American populations, who had no immunity to them. Some historians estimate that up to 90 percent of the native population died from these diseases.

### European Empires

European nations built vast empires through exploration. Spain controlled much of Central and South America. Portugal established colonies in Brazil and trading posts in Africa and Asia. England, France, and the Netherlands also claimed territories around the world.

These empires brought great wealth to European nations through:
- **Mercantilism**: An economic policy in which colonies existed to provide raw materials to the mother country and to buy its manufactured goods
- **Triangular trade**: A trading pattern that connected Europe, Africa, and the Americas
- **Plantation agriculture**: Large farms in the colonies that produced cash crops like sugar, tobacco, and cotton

### Impact on Native Peoples

European exploration and colonization had devastating effects on many native peoples:
- Millions died from European diseases
- Many were forced to work as slaves or servants
- Native cultures and religions were suppressed
- Traditional lands were taken

Some native peoples resisted European conquest, but most were eventually defeated by superior European weapons and the effects of disease.
