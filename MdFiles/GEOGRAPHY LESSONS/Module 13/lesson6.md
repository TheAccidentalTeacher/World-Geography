# Lesson 6: Europe since 1945

## The Big Idea
After years of division during the Cold War, today Europe is working toward unity.

## Main Ideas
- After World War II, Europe was divided between democratic Western Europe and communist Eastern Europe.
- The Cold War shaped European politics, economics, and society for more than four decades.
- The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe led to major political and economic changes.
- European nations are working toward greater unity through the European Union.

## If YOU lived there...
It is November 1989, and you live on the East German side of Berlin. For years the Berlin Wall has divided your city in two. The government has carefully controlled who can cross from East to West. But now there are huge demonstrations against the communist government. Suddenly, officials announce that the border is open. People are streaming through the checkpoints and even climbing on top of the wall.

**Would you join the crowds heading to West Berlin?**

## Europe Divided: The Cold War

World War II left Europe physically devastated and politically divided. The United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the world's superpowers, and their rivalry shaped European history for the next 45 years.

### The Iron Curtain

As World War II ended, Soviet forces occupied much of Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union established communist governments in these countries, creating what Winston Churchill called an "Iron Curtain" dividing Europe:

- **Western Europe**: Democratic governments aligned with the United States
- **Eastern Europe**: Communist governments controlled by the Soviet Union

The division of Europe was formalized through military alliances:
- **NATO** (North Atlantic Treaty Organization): Founded in 1949, it included the United States, Canada, and Western European nations.
- **Warsaw Pact**: Founded in 1955, it included the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states.

### Divided Germany

Germany became the most visible symbol of Europe's division. After the war, Germany was divided into four occupation zones controlled by the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Berlin, located within the Soviet zone, was similarly divided.

In 1949, the three western zones merged to form the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), while the Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). West Germany developed as a democratic, capitalist state, while East Germany became a communist dictatorship.

Berlin remained divided and became a flashpoint in the Cold War:
- In 1948-1949, the Soviets blockaded West Berlin, cutting off land access. The Western allies responded with the Berlin Airlift, flying in supplies for nearly a year until the Soviets lifted the blockade.
- In 1961, East Germany built the Berlin Wall to prevent its citizens from fleeing to the West. The wall became the most powerful symbol of the Cold War division of Europe.

### Cold War Tensions

The Cold War in Europe was characterized by:

- **Arms race**: Both sides built up conventional and nuclear weapons.
- **Espionage**: Intelligence agencies like the CIA and KGB engaged in extensive spying operations.
- **Propaganda**: Both sides used media to promote their ideology and criticize the other.
- **Proxy conflicts**: The superpowers supported opposing sides in conflicts outside Europe.

Several crises heightened tensions:
- **Hungarian Revolution (1956)**: Soviet tanks crushed an uprising against communist rule.
- **Prague Spring (1968)**: A reform movement in Czechoslovakia was suppressed by Warsaw Pact forces.
- **NATO's deployment of nuclear missiles in Western Europe in the 1980s** triggered massive peace protests.

Despite these tensions, direct military conflict between NATO and the Warsaw Pact never occurred in Europe. The threat of nuclear war helped maintain an uneasy peace known as "détente."

## Western Europe: Democracy and Prosperity

After World War II, Western Europe rebuilt its economies and established stable democracies with American support.

### Economic Recovery

The United States launched the **Marshall Plan** in 1948 to help rebuild Western Europe. This massive aid program:
- Provided about $13 billion (equivalent to about $143 billion today)
- Funded infrastructure reconstruction
- Modernized industry
- Stabilized currencies
- Encouraged European economic cooperation

The Marshall Plan was enormously successful. By the mid-1950s, Western European economies had not only recovered but were growing faster than ever before. The period from the 1950s to the early 1970s is often called the "Golden Age" or "Economic Miracle," characterized by:
- Full employment
- Rising living standards
- Expanded social services
- Technological innovation
- Growing consumer culture

### Political Developments

Western European countries developed stable democratic systems after the war:

- **West Germany** established a federal parliamentary democracy with a strong commitment to human rights. The Christian Democratic Union, led by Konrad Adenauer, governed from 1949 to 1969, overseeing economic recovery and reconciliation with former enemies.

- **Italy** became a republic after a 1946 referendum abolished the monarchy. The Christian Democratic Party dominated Italian politics for decades, though governments were often unstable.

- **France** established the Fourth Republic in 1946, but it suffered from political instability. In 1958, Charles de Gaulle returned to power and created the Fifth Republic with a stronger presidency.

- **Britain** alternated between Labour and Conservative governments. The Labour government of 1945-1951 created the National Health Service and nationalized key industries, establishing the British welfare state.

Despite their differences, Western European democracies shared certain features:
- Multi-party systems
- Regular free elections
- Protection of civil liberties
- Mixed economies combining capitalism with social welfare programs

### Social and Cultural Changes

Western Europe experienced significant social and cultural changes:

- **Welfare state**: Most countries expanded social services, including healthcare, education, housing, and pensions.
- **Immigration**: Labor shortages led to immigration from Southern Europe, former colonies, and later from Turkey and North Africa.
- **Youth culture**: The 1960s saw student protests, the sexual revolution, and new forms of music and fashion.
- **Women's rights**: Women gained greater legal equality and entered the workforce in larger numbers.
- **Environmental awareness**: Concerns about pollution and resource depletion grew in the 1970s and 1980s.

### Economic Challenges

The oil crisis of 1973 ended the postwar economic boom. Western Europe faced new challenges:
- High inflation
- Rising unemployment
- Deindustrialization
- Global competition

These problems led to political changes in the 1980s, with conservative leaders like Margaret Thatcher in Britain and Helmut Kohl in West Germany implementing market-oriented reforms:
- Privatization of state-owned industries
- Deregulation
- Reduced trade barriers
- Cuts to social spending

## Eastern Europe: Communist Rule

In Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union imposed communist systems modeled on its own.

### Communist Control

Communist regimes in Eastern Europe shared several features:
- One-party rule by the Communist Party
- State ownership of the economy
- Censorship and restrictions on free expression
- Secret police monitoring citizens
- Close alliance with the Soviet Union

However, there were variations in how strictly these systems were implemented:
- **Poland** and **Hungary** allowed some private agriculture and small businesses
- **Yugoslavia** under Josip Broz Tito broke with the Soviet Union in 1948 and developed its own form of socialism
- **Romania** under Nicolae Ceaușescu became increasingly repressive and isolated

### Economic Development

Communist economies were centrally planned:
- Government agencies set production targets
- Resources were allocated according to state priorities
- Heavy industry and military production were emphasized
- Consumer goods were often scarce and of poor quality

Initially, these economies achieved impressive growth by mobilizing resources for industrialization. However, by the 1970s, they faced serious problems:
- Inefficiency and waste
- Lack of innovation
- Poor-quality goods
- Environmental degradation
- Growing gap with Western living standards

### Resistance and Dissent

Despite repression, resistance to communist rule took various forms:
- **Workers' protests**: East Germany (1953), Hungary (1956), Poland (1970, 1980)
- **Reform movements**: Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring (1968)
- **Dissident intellectuals**: Writers, artists, and academics who criticized the regime
- **Religious activism**: The Catholic Church in Poland became a focus of opposition
- **Samizdat**: Underground publication and circulation of banned literature

The most significant challenge came from Poland's **Solidarity** movement. Founded in 1980 as an independent trade union, Solidarity grew into a broad social movement with 10 million members. Though suppressed under martial law in 1981, it survived underground and eventually helped bring down communist rule.

## The End of the Cold War

In the mid-1980s, dramatic changes began in the Soviet Union that would ultimately end the Cold War and transform Europe.

### Gorbachev's Reforms

In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union. Recognizing the need for change, he introduced two major reform policies:
- **Glasnost** (openness): Greater freedom of speech and information
- **Perestroika** (restructuring): Economic reforms to make the system more efficient

Gorbachev also sought better relations with the West and announced that the Soviet Union would no longer intervene militarily to maintain communist rule in Eastern Europe.

### Revolutions of 1989

In 1989, a wave of mostly peaceful revolutions swept across Eastern Europe:

- **Poland**: After roundtable negotiations, Solidarity participated in partially free elections in June and won overwhelmingly. By August, Poland had its first non-communist government since the 1940s.

- **Hungary**: The Communist Party embraced reform, opened its border with Austria, dismantled the Iron Curtain, and allowed free elections.

- **East Germany**: Mass protests and a flood of refugees led to the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, the most dramatic symbol of the end of the Cold War.

- **Czechoslovakia**: The "Velvet Revolution" brought playwright and dissident Václav Havel to power.

- **Bulgaria**: The Communist Party leadership was forced to resign.

- **Romania**: A violent uprising led to the overthrow and execution of dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu.

By the end of 1989, communist rule had collapsed throughout Eastern Europe.

### German Reunification

The fall of the Berlin Wall led quickly to German reunification:
- In March 1990, East Germany held its first free elections
- On October 3, 1990, East and West Germany formally reunited as one nation
- Berlin once again became the capital of a united Germany

Reunification brought challenges:
- The East German economy needed massive investment to modernize
- Unemployment rose as inefficient state enterprises closed
- Cultural differences between East and West persisted
- The cost of reunification strained the German economy

Nevertheless, reunification was a powerful symbol of Europe overcoming its Cold War division.

### Dissolution of the Soviet Union

The changes in Eastern Europe contributed to the breakup of the Soviet Union itself:
- Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) declared independence
- Other Soviet republics followed suit
- On December 25, 1991, Gorbachev resigned and the Soviet Union ceased to exist

The end of the Soviet Union marked the definitive end of the Cold War and created a new geopolitical landscape in Europe.

## Post-Cold War Europe

The end of the Cold War created both opportunities and challenges for Europe.

### Transition in Eastern Europe

Former communist countries faced the difficult task of transitioning to democracy and market economies:

- **Political transition**: New constitutions, free elections, independent media, and civil society organizations were established.

- **Economic transition**: State-owned enterprises were privatized, prices were liberalized, and market institutions were created. This "shock therapy" caused severe hardship in many countries, with rising unemployment, inflation, and inequality.

- **Social transition**: Citizens had to adapt to new political freedoms and economic uncertainties. Some groups, especially the elderly and less educated, struggled with these changes.

The transition proceeded at different rates:
- **Central European countries** (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic) adapted relatively successfully
- **Southeastern European countries** (Romania, Bulgaria) faced greater difficulties
- **Former Soviet republics** experienced varying degrees of success, with the Baltic states doing better than Ukraine or Belarus

### Conflict in the Balkans

The most tragic post-Cold War development was the violent breakup of Yugoslavia:

- In 1991-1992, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia declared independence
- Serbia, led by Slobodan Milošević, sought to create a "Greater Serbia"
- War broke out, particularly in Croatia and Bosnia
- "Ethnic cleansing" (forced removal of ethnic groups) and genocide occurred
- NATO eventually intervened with airstrikes against Serbian forces
- The Dayton Agreement ended the Bosnian War in 1995

In 1998-1999, conflict erupted in Kosovo, leading to another NATO intervention. Milošević was overthrown in 2000 and later put on trial for war crimes. In 2006, Montenegro became independent, and in 2008, Kosovo declared independence (though not all countries recognize it).

The Balkan conflicts showed that ethnic nationalism remained a powerful and potentially destructive force in Europe.

## European Unity

Despite these challenges, Europe has moved toward greater unity since the end of the Cold War.

### The European Union

The **European Union** (EU) evolved from earlier organizations established after World War II to promote economic cooperation. Key developments included:

- **European Coal and Steel Community** (1951): France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg integrated their coal and steel industries.

- **European Economic Community** (1957): The same six countries created a common market with free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor.

- **European Community** (1967): Merged institutions of previous organizations.

- **Maastricht Treaty** (1992): Created the European Union, established EU citizenship, and planned for a common currency.

- **Euro** (1999/2002): The common currency was introduced for electronic transactions in 1999 and as physical money in 2002.

- **Expansion**: The EU grew from 6 to 28 members (27 after Brexit):
  - 1973: Denmark, Ireland, United Kingdom
  - 1981: Greece
  - 1986: Portugal, Spain
  - 1995: Austria, Finland, Sweden
  - 2004: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia
  - 2007: Bulgaria, Romania
  - 2013: Croatia

### EU Institutions

The EU has several key institutions:

- **European Commission**: Executive body that proposes legislation and implements decisions
- **Council of the European Union**: Represents member state governments
- **European Parliament**: Directly elected by EU citizens
- **European Court of Justice**: Ensures EU law is interpreted and applied consistently
- **European Central Bank**: Manages the euro and monetary policy

### Benefits and Challenges

The EU has brought many benefits to Europeans:
- Peace and stability
- Economic growth through free trade
- Freedom to live, work, and study anywhere in the EU
- Consumer protections and environmental standards
- Development aid for poorer regions

However, the EU also faces significant challenges:
- **Democratic deficit**: Many citizens feel the EU is distant and unaccountable
- **Economic disparities**: Significant differences remain between richer and poorer members
- **Euro crisis**: The 2008 financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the eurozone structure
- **Migration**: The 2015 refugee crisis strained EU solidarity
- **Rise of Euroskepticism**: Political parties opposing European integration have gained support
- **Brexit**: In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU, formally departing in 2020

### Europe in the 21st Century

Today's Europe faces several key issues:

- **Aging population**: Low birth rates and longer life expectancy are creating demographic challenges for welfare systems.

- **Immigration**: Europe has become a destination for migrants from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, raising questions about integration and identity.

- **Energy security**: Many European countries depend on imported energy, particularly Russian natural gas.

- **Climate change**: The EU has taken a leading role in efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

- **Relations with Russia**: Russia's assertiveness, particularly in Ukraine, has created new tensions.

- **Terrorism**: Attacks by extremist groups have raised security concerns.

- **Populism**: Populist parties challenging mainstream politics have gained support in many countries.

Despite these challenges, Europe today is largely peaceful, prosperous, and democratic—a remarkable transformation from the war-torn continent of 1945. The European project of integration, though imperfect, has helped overcome centuries of conflict and division.
