# Lesson 4: World War I

## The Big Idea
World War I and the peace treaty that followed brought tremendous change to Europe.

## Main Ideas
- Nationalism, militarism, and a system of alliances led to the outbreak of World War I in 1914.
- New weapons and tactics made World War I more deadly than previous wars.
- The Treaty of Versailles punished Germany and redrew the map of Europe.
- The war had far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences.

## If YOU lived there...
It is 1914, and you live in London. For years you have heard about an important alliance between Great Britain, France, and Russia. Each country has promised to defend the others if they are attacked. Now war has broken out on the European continent. Germany has invaded Belgium and is moving toward France. Many young men are volunteering to join the army.

**Would you volunteer to fight in the war?**

## Causes of World War I

World War I began in the summer of 1914 and lasted until November 1918. It was called the "Great War" or the "War to End All Wars" because of its unprecedented scale and destruction. Several long-term causes contributed to the outbreak of the war.

### Nationalism

**Nationalism**, the belief that loyalty to one's nation should come before all else, was a powerful force in early 20th-century Europe. While nationalism could be a positive force for unity within countries, it also created tensions between nations:

- Countries competed for power, prestige, and territory.
- Nationalist groups within multinational empires (like Austria-Hungary) demanded independence.
- National pride made countries less willing to compromise in international disputes.

In the Balkans (southeastern Europe), nationalism was particularly volatile. As the Ottoman Empire declined, various ethnic groups sought independence. Serbia, which had gained independence in the 19th century, wanted to create a larger South Slavic state that would include Slavic territories still under Austrian control.

### Imperialism

By the early 1900s, European powers had built vast colonial empires in Africa and Asia. This **imperialism** led to rivalries as nations competed for territory and resources:

- Britain and France competed for colonies in Africa.
- Germany, which had unified late (1871), felt it deserved a larger colonial empire.
- Russia and Austria-Hungary competed for influence in the Balkans.

These imperial rivalries increased tensions and made countries more willing to use military force to protect their interests.

### Militarism

**Militarism**—the glorification of military power and values—was widespread in pre-war Europe. Countries built up their armed forces and developed war plans:

- Germany expanded its navy, challenging British naval supremacy.
- France and Russia increased the size of their armies.
- Military leaders gained influence in government decision-making.
- War was often portrayed as glorious and heroic in popular culture.

The arms race created an atmosphere of fear and suspicion. Each country's military buildup seemed threatening to its neighbors, leading to further military expansion.

### Alliance System

By 1914, Europe was divided into two opposing alliance systems:

- **Triple Alliance** (later Central Powers): Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy
- **Triple Entente** (later Allied Powers): Great Britain, France, and Russia

These alliances were meant to maintain a balance of power and prevent war. Instead, they had the opposite effect:

- Countries felt obligated to support their allies, even in disputes they might otherwise avoid.
- A conflict between two countries could quickly draw in others.
- The alliance system made countries less flexible in diplomatic negotiations.

### Immediate Cause: Assassination in Sarajevo

The spark that ignited World War I came on June 28, 1914, when Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated in Sarajevo, Bosnia. The assassin, Gavrilo Princip, was a Bosnian Serb nationalist who wanted Bosnia to become part of Serbia.

Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia for the assassination and, with German support, issued an ultimatum with harsh demands. When Serbia didn't accept all the terms, Austria-Hungary declared war on July 28, 1914. This set off a chain reaction:

- Russia mobilized its army to support Serbia.
- Germany declared war on Russia (August 1) and France (August 3).
- Germany invaded neutral Belgium to attack France, leading Britain to declare war on Germany (August 4).

What might have remained a local conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia quickly escalated into a continental war.

## The War Unfolds

When the war began in August 1914, most people expected it to be short. "The boys will be home by Christmas," many said. Instead, the war lasted more than four years and became one of the deadliest conflicts in history.

### The Western Front

Germany's war plan, the Schlieffen Plan, called for a quick defeat of France before turning to fight Russia. German forces invaded Belgium and advanced rapidly toward Paris. But the Allies stopped the German advance at the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914.

After this battle, both sides dug trenches for protection. By the end of 1914, a system of trenches stretched about 400 miles from the English Channel to the Swiss border. This became known as the Western Front.

For the next three years, the war on the Western Front was characterized by **trench warfare**:

- Opposing trenches were separated by "no man's land," an area of open ground.
- Soldiers lived in muddy, rat-infested trenches, exposed to weather and disease.
- Attacks typically began with artillery bombardments, followed by infantry charges across no man's land.
- Defensive weapons like machine guns and barbed wire made these attacks extremely costly.
- Neither side could gain a decisive advantage, resulting in a bloody stalemate.

Major battles on the Western Front included:

- **Verdun** (1916): A German offensive aimed at "bleeding France white." The battle lasted 10 months and resulted in about 700,000 casualties.
- **Somme** (1916): A British-led offensive that began with the war's heaviest artillery bombardment. On the first day alone, the British suffered about 60,000 casualties, including nearly 20,000 dead.
- **Passchendaele** (1917): Also known as the Third Battle of Ypres, this British offensive gained only a few miles of muddy terrain at the cost of hundreds of thousands of casualties.

### The Eastern Front

On the Eastern Front, Russia fought against Germany and Austria-Hungary. This front was more mobile than the Western Front, with armies advancing and retreating over large areas.

In August 1914, Russia invaded East Prussia but was defeated at the Battles of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes. On the Austro-Hungarian front, Russian forces were more successful initially, but by 1915 they were in retreat.

The war went badly for Russia:
- Its industry couldn't produce enough weapons and ammunition.
- Its transportation system couldn't efficiently move troops and supplies.
- Its soldiers were often poorly trained and equipped.
- By 1917, morale was low, and many soldiers were deserting.

These problems contributed to the Russian Revolution of 1917, which overthrew Tsar Nicholas II. The new communist government, led by Vladimir Lenin, signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in March 1918, taking Russia out of the war.

### Other Fronts

The war was truly global, with fighting in Africa, the Middle East, and the Pacific:

- In the **Middle East**, the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers. British forces fought Ottoman troops in Egypt, Palestine, and Mesopotamia (Iraq). The British encouraged Arab nationalism against Ottoman rule, leading to the Arab Revolt of 1916.

- In the **Balkans**, Serbia was defeated by 1915. Bulgaria joined the Central Powers, while Greece and Romania eventually joined the Allies.

- In **Africa**, Allied forces seized German colonies.

- At **sea**, the British navy blockaded Germany, cutting off vital supplies. Germany responded with submarine (U-boat) warfare, sinking merchant ships. The sinking of the British passenger liner Lusitania in 1915, which killed 128 Americans, turned U.S. opinion against Germany.

### New Weapons and Tactics

World War I saw the introduction of new weapons that made the fighting more deadly:

- **Machine guns** could fire hundreds of rounds per minute, making infantry attacks extremely costly.
- **Artillery** became more accurate and destructive, causing the majority of casualties.
- **Poison gas** (chlorine, phosgene, and mustard gas) caused painful injuries and death.
- **Tanks** were developed by the British to break through trench lines.
- **Aircraft** were used initially for reconnaissance but later for bombing and aerial combat.
- **Submarines** threatened naval and merchant shipping.

These technological developments gave defenders an advantage over attackers, contributing to the war's stalemate and high casualty rates.

### Total War

World War I was a "total war" that mobilized entire societies:

- **Industrial mobilization**: Factories were converted to produce weapons and military supplies.
- **Economic controls**: Governments regulated prices, rationed food and fuel, and raised taxes.
- **Propaganda**: Governments used posters, films, and censorship to maintain public support.
- **Women in the workforce**: As men went to fight, women took jobs in factories, offices, and farms.

The home front became almost as important as the battlefield. A country's ability to produce weapons, maintain morale, and feed its population was crucial to its war effort.

### The United States Enters the War

The United States initially remained neutral, though it traded extensively with the Allies. Several factors drew America into the war:

- **Unrestricted submarine warfare**: In early 1917, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare, sinking ships without warning.
- **Zimmermann Telegram**: Germany proposed an alliance with Mexico against the United States, promising to help Mexico recover territories lost to the U.S.
- **Russian Revolution**: The overthrow of the Russian tsar made it easier for Americans to support the Allies as "fighting for democracy."

The United States declared war on Germany in April 1917. American troops began arriving in Europe in large numbers in 1918, providing the Allies with fresh soldiers and resources.

### The War Ends

By 1918, the Central Powers were weakening:
- The British naval blockade had severely damaged the German economy.
- Austria-Hungary was struggling with internal nationalist movements.
- The Ottoman Empire was losing territory in the Middle East.

In the spring of 1918, Germany launched a final offensive on the Western Front, hoping to win before American troops arrived in force. The offensive initially gained ground but was stopped by Allied forces.

In the summer and fall of 1918, the Allies counterattacked and began pushing the Germans back. Bulgaria surrendered in September, followed by the Ottoman Empire in October and Austria-Hungary in early November.

Facing military defeat, food shortages, and revolution at home, Germany signed an armistice on November 11, 1918, ending the fighting.

## The Peace Settlement

After the war ended, the victorious Allied powers met at the Paris Peace Conference to negotiate peace terms. The conference resulted in five treaties with the defeated nations, the most important being the Treaty of Versailles with Germany.

### The Treaty of Versailles

The Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1919, contained several key provisions:

1. **War guilt clause**: Germany was forced to accept sole responsibility for causing the war.

2. **Reparations**: Germany had to pay for war damages, eventually set at 132 billion gold marks (about $33 billion).

3. **Military restrictions**: Germany's army was limited to 100,000 men; its navy was reduced, and it was forbidden to have an air force, tanks, or submarines.

4. **Territorial losses**: Germany lost about 13 percent of its territory:
   - Alsace-Lorraine returned to France
   - Parts of eastern Germany went to the newly created Poland
   - Germany lost all its overseas colonies

5. **Demilitarization**: The Rhineland (German territory west of the Rhine River) was demilitarized.

6. **League of Nations**: A new international organization was created to prevent future wars, but Germany was not allowed to join initially.

The German people felt the treaty was extremely harsh and unfair. They particularly resented the war guilt clause and the heavy reparations. This resentment would later contribute to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party.

### Redrawing the Map of Europe

The peace settlement dramatically changed the map of Europe:

- **New nations** were created from the former Austro-Hungarian Empire: Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.
- **Poland** was re-established as an independent nation.
- **Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania** gained independence from Russia.
- The **Ottoman Empire** was dismantled, with much of its Middle Eastern territory placed under British and French control as "mandates."

The peace settlement attempted to apply the principle of **self-determination**—the idea that ethnic groups should have their own nations. However, this principle was not consistently applied, and many ethnic minorities found themselves living in new countries where they were not the dominant group.

## Consequences of the War

World War I had profound and far-reaching consequences for Europe and the world.

### Human and Material Costs

The war's human toll was staggering:
- About 9 million soldiers died.
- Another 21 million were wounded.
- Millions of civilians died from starvation, disease, and military action.

The material destruction was also enormous:
- Cities, towns, and villages were destroyed.
- Farmland was rendered unusable by shells, mines, and trenches.
- Industrial areas in northern France and Belgium were devastated.

The financial cost of the war was estimated at over $330 billion. European countries accumulated huge debts, particularly to the United States.

### Political Changes

The war led to significant political changes:

- **Fall of empires**: Four major empires collapsed—the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian.
- **Spread of democracy**: Many of the new states created after the war adopted democratic constitutions, at least initially.
- **Rise of communism**: The Russian Revolution brought the Communists to power, inspiring communist movements in other countries.
- **Colonial unrest**: The war weakened European powers and stimulated independence movements in their colonies.

### Social Changes

The war accelerated social changes that were already underway:

- **Women's rights**: Women's contributions to the war effort strengthened the case for women's suffrage. Many countries granted women the right to vote after the war.
- **Class relations**: The shared experience of combat somewhat reduced class distinctions in some countries.
- **Government role**: People became accustomed to greater government involvement in the economy and daily life.

### Cultural Impact

The war's horror and disillusionment influenced art, literature, and thought:

- Writers like Erich Maria Remarque (*All Quiet on the Western Front*) and poets like Wilfred Owen portrayed the war's brutality and futility.
- Artists developed new styles like Dadaism and Surrealism that rejected traditional values and emphasized absurdity.
- Many people questioned pre-war values and beliefs, leading to a sense of disillusionment and cynicism.

### Seeds of Future Conflict

Perhaps most significantly, World War I set the stage for World War II:

- The harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles created resentment in Germany.
- Economic problems, worsened by reparations payments, contributed to the Great Depression.
- New nations in Eastern Europe faced economic and ethnic challenges.
- The League of Nations proved too weak to maintain peace.

What was supposed to be "the war to end all wars" instead created conditions that would lead to an even more destructive conflict just two decades later.
