# Lesson 5: World War II

## The Big Idea
Problems in Europe led to World War II, the deadliest war in history.

## Main Ideas
- The rise of dictators in Europe after World War I led to World War II.
- The Holocaust was the systematic murder of six million Jews and millions of others by Nazi Germany.
- The Allies defeated the Axis Powers, but at an enormous cost in lives and destruction.
- The war changed the balance of global power and led to the Cold War.

## If YOU lived there...
It is 1922, and you are part of a huge crowd in one of Rome's public squares. Everyone is listening to the fiery speech of a dynamic new leader. He promises to make Italy great again and to solve the country's economic problems. Some of your friends are excited by his promises. Others are worried about his violent followers and his attacks on democracy.

**Would you support this new leader?**

## Rise of Dictators

After World War I, democracy seemed to be spreading across Europe. However, the 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of dictatorships in many European countries. Several factors contributed to this trend:

- **Economic problems**: The Great Depression (1929-1939) caused widespread unemployment and hardship.
- **Fear of communism**: Many middle-class and wealthy people feared communist revolution.
- **Nationalism**: Extreme nationalism led people to support strong leaders who promised to restore national pride.
- **Disillusionment with democracy**: Democratic governments seemed unable to solve economic and social problems.

### Fascism in Italy

The first major fascist dictator was Benito Mussolini in Italy. **Fascism** is an extreme form of nationalism characterized by:
- Glorification of the state and the nation
- One-party rule under a strong leader
- Suppression of opposition
- Control of the economy by the government and big business
- Militarism and the use of violence

Italy had serious problems after World War I:
- High unemployment and inflation
- Social unrest and strikes
- Resentment over territorial gains promised but not received in peace treaties

Mussolini formed the Fascist Party in 1919. His "Black Shirt" followers used violence against political opponents. In 1922, Mussolini organized the "March on Rome," threatening to seize power by force. King Victor Emmanuel III appointed Mussolini as prime minister to avoid civil war.

Once in power, Mussolini gradually established a dictatorship:
- He outlawed other political parties
- He censored the press
- He used secret police to intimidate opponents
- He took control of the economy
- He built up the military

Mussolini called his regime the "Corporate State." He claimed to have ended class conflict by organizing the economy into employer and worker associations controlled by the government.

### Nazi Germany

The most dangerous dictator to emerge was Adolf Hitler in Germany. Hitler led the National Socialist German Workers' Party, or Nazi Party. Like Mussolini, Hitler was a fascist, but he added a strong element of racial hatred, particularly antisemitism (hatred of Jews).

Germany faced severe problems after World War I:
- The humiliating Treaty of Versailles
- Massive inflation in the early 1920s
- The Great Depression, which hit Germany especially hard
- Political instability in the Weimar Republic (Germany's democratic government)

Hitler promised to:
- Tear up the Treaty of Versailles
- Restore German power and pride
- Provide jobs and economic stability
- Create a "pure" German racial state
- Expand German territory for "living space" (Lebensraum)

Hitler became chancellor (prime minister) of Germany in January 1933. Within months, he established a dictatorship:
- The Reichstag (parliament) building fire was used as an excuse to suspend civil liberties
- The Enabling Act gave Hitler the power to rule by decree
- Other political parties were banned
- Labor unions were abolished
- A secret police force, the Gestapo, terrorized opponents
- Books were burned and the media was controlled

Hitler's economic policies initially seemed successful. He launched public works projects like building highways (autobahns) and rearming Germany, which created jobs. By 1936, unemployment had fallen dramatically.

Hitler began persecuting Jews immediately:
- In 1935, the Nuremberg Laws deprived Jews of German citizenship and prohibited marriage between Jews and non-Jews
- In November 1938, Kristallnacht ("Night of Broken Glass") saw Nazi-organized attacks on Jewish homes, businesses, and synagogues
- Jews were gradually excluded from public life, education, and most professions

### Other Dictatorships

Dictatorships also emerged in other European countries:
- **Spain**: After a brutal civil war (1936-1939), General Francisco Franco established a fascist dictatorship.
- **Portugal**: António Salazar ruled as a dictator from 1932 to 1968.
- **Soviet Union**: While not fascist, Joseph Stalin's communist dictatorship was equally brutal. Stalin's Great Purge (1936-1938) killed millions of perceived opponents.

By the late 1930s, democracy survived in only a few European countries, including Britain, France, and the Scandinavian nations.

## The Road to War

Hitler's foreign policy aimed to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and expand German territory. His aggressive actions eventually led to war.

### Hitler's Early Moves

Hitler began challenging the Treaty of Versailles soon after taking power:
- In 1933, Germany withdrew from the League of Nations.
- In 1935, Hitler announced German rearmament, violating the treaty's military restrictions.
- In 1936, German troops entered the Rhineland, which was supposed to remain demilitarized.

Britain and France did not resist these moves. They followed a policy of **appeasement**—giving in to Hitler's demands to avoid war. Many British and French leaders:
- Felt the Treaty of Versailles had been too harsh on Germany
- Feared another devastating war
- Were preoccupied with economic problems
- Hoped Hitler would be satisfied with limited territorial gains

### Expansion and Aggression

Hitler grew bolder:
- In March 1938, German troops entered Austria, and Hitler announced the Anschluss (union) of Austria with Germany.
- In September 1938, Hitler demanded the Sudetenland, a region of Czechoslovakia with a large German population.

At the Munich Conference, Britain and France agreed to let Germany annex the Sudetenland in return for Hitler's promise to make no more territorial demands. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain returned from Munich claiming he had secured "peace for our time."

The policy of appeasement failed:
- In March 1939, Hitler broke his promise and took over the rest of Czechoslovakia.
- In August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Nazi-Soviet Pact, agreeing not to fight each other and secretly planning to divide Poland between them.
- On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland.

Britain and France had guaranteed Poland's independence. When Germany refused to withdraw, Britain and France declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939. World War II in Europe had begun.

### Japan's Aggression in Asia

Meanwhile, Japan was pursuing its own expansionist policies in Asia:
- In 1931, Japan occupied Manchuria, a region of China.
- In 1937, Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China, committing atrocities like the Nanjing Massacre.
- In 1940, Japan occupied French Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia).

These actions brought Japan into conflict with the United States, which opposed Japanese expansion and supported China.

## The Course of the War

World War II was fought on a scale never seen before, across multiple theaters of war and involving countries on every continent.

### Early German Victories (1939-1941)

Germany's early attacks used **blitzkrieg** ("lightning war")—a strategy combining fast-moving tanks, motorized infantry, and air power to break through enemy lines and encircle opposing forces.

Poland fell quickly in September 1939. The Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland according to the Nazi-Soviet Pact.

After a period of limited fighting known as the "Phony War," Germany launched a major offensive in April 1940:
- Denmark and Norway were quickly conquered
- The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg fell in May
- France was defeated in just six weeks, surrendering in June 1940

Britain, led by new Prime Minister Winston Churchill, fought on alone. The **Battle of Britain** was an air battle fought from July to October 1940. The Royal Air Force (RAF) defeated the German Luftwaffe, preventing a German invasion of Britain.

In April 1941, Germany invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. In June 1941, Hitler launched **Operation Barbarossa**, a massive invasion of the Soviet Union. Despite initial successes, the German advance was stopped by the Russian winter and fierce Soviet resistance.

### The Holocaust

As German forces conquered territory, they began implementing the **Holocaust**—the systematic murder of Jews and other groups deemed "undesirable" by the Nazis. The Holocaust proceeded in stages:

1. **Concentration**: Jews were forced into ghettos or concentration camps.
2. **Mass killings**: After the invasion of the Soviet Union, special Nazi units called Einsatzgruppen shot hundreds of thousands of Jews.
3. **Death camps**: Beginning in 1942, the Nazis established death camps equipped with gas chambers for mass murder. The largest was Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland.

By the end of the war, about six million Jews—two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population—had been murdered. The Nazis also killed millions of others, including:
- Roma (Gypsies)
- People with disabilities
- Soviet prisoners of war
- Polish civilians
- Political opponents
- Homosexuals

The Holocaust was unprecedented in its systematic, state-organized nature and its goal of completely eliminating an entire people.

### The War Widens (1941-1942)

In December 1941, the war became truly global when Japan attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The United States declared war on Japan the next day. Germany and Italy, Japan's allies, then declared war on the United States.

The three major Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—now faced the Allied powers, primarily the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union.

Japan quickly conquered much of Southeast Asia and the western Pacific:
- The Philippines (an American colony)
- British colonies of Hong Kong, Malaya, and Singapore
- Dutch East Indies (Indonesia)
- Many Pacific islands

By mid-1942, the Axis powers were at the height of their power:
- Germany controlled most of Europe from France to deep into the Soviet Union
- Japan controlled much of East and Southeast Asia and many Pacific islands
- Italy controlled parts of North Africa

### The Turning Point (1942-1943)

In 1942 and 1943, the tide of war began to turn in favor of the Allies:

In the **Pacific Theater**:
- The Battle of the Coral Sea (May 1942) stopped Japanese expansion toward Australia
- The Battle of Midway (June 1942) was a decisive American victory that destroyed four Japanese aircraft carriers
- Allied forces began a strategy of "island hopping," capturing key islands while bypassing others

In the **Eastern Front**:
- The Battle of Stalingrad (August 1942-February 1943) ended in a devastating German defeat
- The Battle of Kursk (July 1943) was the largest tank battle in history and another Soviet victory

In the **Mediterranean Theater**:
- British forces defeated the Germans and Italians at El Alamein in Egypt (October-November 1942)
- Allied forces invaded Sicily and mainland Italy (1943)
- Italy surrendered in September 1943, though German forces continued fighting in Italy

### Allied Victory (1944-1945)

By 1944, the Allies were advancing on all fronts:

In **Western Europe**:
- On D-Day (June 6, 1944), Allied forces landed in Normandy, France, in the largest amphibious invasion in history
- Paris was liberated in August 1944
- The Battle of the Bulge (December 1944-January 1945) was the last major German offensive

In **Eastern Europe**:
- Soviet forces pushed westward through Poland and the Balkans
- By early 1945, they were approaching Berlin

In the **Pacific**:
- American forces recaptured the Philippines
- American bombers conducted massive air raids on Japanese cities
- Iwo Jima and Okinawa, islands close to Japan, were captured after fierce battles

The war in Europe ended on May 8, 1945 (V-E Day), when Germany surrendered unconditionally after Soviet forces captured Berlin and Hitler committed suicide.

The war in the Pacific ended on August 15, 1945 (V-J Day), when Japan surrendered after the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima (August 6) and Nagasaki (August 9), and the Soviet Union declared war on Japan.

## Impact of the War

World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, with profound and far-reaching consequences.

### Human and Material Costs

The war's human toll was staggering:
- Total deaths are estimated at 70-85 million people
- About 50-55 million were civilians
- The Soviet Union suffered the highest losses, with about 27 million dead
- China lost about 15-20 million people
- Poland lost about 6 million (including 3 million Polish Jews)
- Germany lost about 7 million
- Japan lost about 3 million

The material destruction was enormous:
- Cities across Europe and Asia were reduced to rubble
- Industrial facilities were destroyed
- Transportation networks were devastated
- Agricultural production was disrupted, leading to food shortages

### Political Changes

The war dramatically changed the global political landscape:

- **Decline of European powers**: Britain and France were weakened and soon lost their colonial empires.
- **Rise of superpowers**: The United States and the Soviet Union emerged as the world's dominant powers.
- **Division of Europe**: Eastern Europe came under Soviet control, while Western Europe aligned with the United States.
- **United Nations**: A new international organization was created to maintain peace and security.
- **Decolonization**: The war accelerated independence movements in European colonies in Asia and Africa.

### The Cold War

Perhaps the most significant political consequence was the beginning of the **Cold War**—a state of political and military tension between the United States and its allies (the Western bloc) and the Soviet Union and its allies (the Eastern bloc).

The Cold War was characterized by:
- An arms race, including nuclear weapons
- Ideological competition between capitalism and communism
- Proxy wars in countries like Korea and Vietnam
- The division of Germany and Berlin
- The formation of military alliances (NATO and the Warsaw Pact)

The Cold War would dominate international relations for the next 45 years.

### Social and Economic Changes

The war accelerated social and economic changes:

- **Women's roles**: Women took on new roles during the war, working in factories and serving in auxiliary military units. After the war, many continued to work outside the home.
- **Civil rights**: The contradiction between fighting against Nazi racism while maintaining discrimination at home strengthened civil rights movements in the United States and elsewhere.
- **Economic recovery**: The Marshall Plan provided American aid to rebuild Western Europe, leading to unprecedented prosperity in the 1950s and 1960s.
- **Scientific and technological advances**: Wartime research led to developments in electronics, aviation, medicine, and nuclear energy.

### Moral Legacy

The war's moral legacy includes:

- **Human rights**: The Holocaust led to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the Genocide Convention.
- **War crimes trials**: The Nuremberg Trials established the principle that individuals could be held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
- **Nuclear weapons**: The development and use of atomic bombs raised profound moral questions about warfare in the nuclear age.
