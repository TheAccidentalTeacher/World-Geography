# Lesson 5: Scandinavia

## The Big Idea
Scandinavia has developed into one of the most stable and prosperous regions in Europe.

## Main Ideas
- The Nordic countries share similar cultures, political systems, and high standards of living.
- Despite harsh climates and limited natural resources in some areas, the Nordic countries have built strong, innovative economies.

## If YOU lived there...
You live in Stockholm, Sweden. Like most Swedes, you enjoy a high standard of living with excellent public services. Your healthcare and education are paid for through taxes. When you have children, you'll be entitled to generous parental leave. However, you pay some of the highest taxes in the world—about 30 to 60 percent of your income. Some of your friends think the taxes are too high, while others believe they're necessary to maintain Sweden's social welfare system.

**Do you think the benefits of Sweden's system are worth the high taxes?**

## The Nordic Countries

The Nordic countries—Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland—are often referred to collectively as Scandinavia, though technically Scandinavia includes only Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. These countries share many cultural, historical, and political characteristics, as well as a reputation for high living standards and social welfare.
