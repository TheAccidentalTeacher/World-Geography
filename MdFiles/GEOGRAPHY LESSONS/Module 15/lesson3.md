# Lesson 3: Germany and the Alpine Countries

## The Big Idea
Germany and the Alpine Countries are prosperous countries with similar cultures.

## Main Ideas
- Germany is the economic powerhouse of Europe with a strong industrial base and export-oriented economy.
- The Alpine countries of Switzerland, Austria, and Liechtenstein share mountainous terrain, cultural ties, and prosperous economies.

## If YOU lived there...
You live in a small village in the Alps. For generations, your family has raised dairy cows on the mountain slopes. During the summer, you take the cows to high mountain pastures where they graze on the rich grass. In winter, you bring them down to the valley. Tourism has been growing in your region, and many farmers are selling their land for ski resorts and vacation homes.

**Would you continue the traditional farming lifestyle or take advantage of tourism opportunities?**
