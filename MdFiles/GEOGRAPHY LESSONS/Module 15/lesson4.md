# Lesson 4: The British Isles

## The Big Idea
Close cultural and historical ties link the people of the British Isles today.

## Main Ideas
- The United Kingdom is a major economic and cultural power with a rich history.
- Ireland is a small but dynamic country with a distinct cultural identity.

## If YOU lived there...
You live in Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. Your family has lived there for generations. Some of your relatives consider themselves British, while others identify as Irish. The region has a history of conflict between those who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK and those who want it to join the Republic of Ireland. Although a peace agreement was reached in 1998, tensions sometimes still arise.

**How would you navigate the complex identities in Northern Ireland?**

## The United Kingdom

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (commonly known as the UK) consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. It has played a major role in world history and continues to be an important global power.
