# Lesson 3: The Caucasus

## The Big Idea
In an area long ruled by outside groups, the Caucasus republics are struggling to strengthen their economies and to deal with ethnic unrest.

## Main Ideas
- Many groups have ruled and influenced the Caucasus during its long history.
- Today, the Caucasus republics are working to improve their economies, but they struggle with ethnic unrest and conflict.

## Key Terms and Places
- Tbilisi
- Yerevan
- Baku

## If YOU lived there...
You live in Tbilisi, the capital of the country of Georgia. Several years ago, your sister and her college friends joined the Rose Revolution, a political protest that forced a corrupt president to resign. The protesters' symbol was a red rose. Since the protest, you have become more interested in politics.

**What kind of government do you want?**

## History

The Caucasus lies in the rugged Caucasus Mountains between the Black and Caspian seas. Located where Europe blends into Asia, it reflects a range of cultural influences. Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Turks, and Mongols have all ruled or invaded the area. The Russians took control in the early 1800s.

Russian control in the Caucasus did not include what is now western Armenia. The Ottoman Turks held this area. Over time, the Turks grew to distrust the Armenians, however, and in the late 1800s began abusing and killing them. During World War I (1914–1918), the Turks forced all Armenians to leave. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians died during this ethnic cleansing, or attempt to remove an ethnic group. The Turks lost World War I, though, and had to give up western Armenia.

After World War I, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia gained independence—but not for long. By the early 1920s they were part of the vast Soviet Union. Finally, in 1991, when the Soviet Union fell, the Caucasus republics achieved true independence.

## The Caucasus Today

The Caucasus may have a long history, but the Caucasus countries do not. Like other former Soviet republics, these young countries have had to create new governments and economies. Meanwhile, ethnic unrest and conflicts have slowed progress.

The Caucasus republics have similar governments. An elected president governs each nation, and an appointed prime minister runs each government. An elected parliament, or legislature, makes the laws.

### Georgia

Georgia is located on the eastern shore of the Black Sea. Its capital, Tbilisi (tuh-buh-LEE-see), is one of the oldest cities in the world. Georgia has a long history as a Christian kingdom, and most Georgians belong to the Georgian Orthodox Church.

Georgia has faced significant challenges since gaining independence. In the early 1990s, civil war broke out as different groups fought for power. Two regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, declared independence from Georgia, leading to ongoing conflicts. In 2008, Georgia and Russia fought a brief war over South Ossetia, with Russia supporting the separatists.

Georgia has worked to build a democratic system and market economy. The Rose Revolution of 2003, a peaceful protest movement, forced the resignation of President Eduard Shevardnadze and brought reformist Mikheil Saakashvili to power. Georgia has implemented economic reforms and sought closer ties with the European Union and NATO, which has strained relations with Russia.

Despite these challenges, Georgia has made progress. Its economy has grown, particularly in sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and transportation. The country is known for its wine production, a tradition dating back thousands of years.

### Armenia

Armenia is a landlocked country in the southern Caucasus. Its capital is Yerevan (yeh-ruh-VAHN), one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities. Armenia has a rich cultural heritage and was the first nation to adopt Christianity as its official religion, in the early 4th century.

Armenia faces economic challenges due to its landlocked position and closed borders with two of its neighbors. Its border with Turkey has been closed since 1993 due to the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, and its border with Azerbaijan is also closed. This isolation has limited trade and economic development.

The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan, has been a major issue for Armenia. Fighting over the region broke out in the late 1980s and continued until a ceasefire in 1994, with Armenia supporting the separatist forces. The conflict flared up again in 2020, resulting in significant territorial losses for the Armenian side.

Despite these challenges, Armenia has worked to develop its economy, focusing on sectors such as information technology, tourism, and mining. The country has a large diaspora, with more Armenians living outside the country than within it, and remittances from abroad are an important source of income.

### Azerbaijan

Azerbaijan is located on the western shore of the Caspian Sea. Its capital, Baku (BAH-koo), is a major port and oil center. Azerbaijan is predominantly Muslim, with a mix of Shia and Sunni traditions, though the country is officially secular.

Azerbaijan's economy is dominated by oil and natural gas production. The country has significant reserves, particularly in the Caspian Sea, and has developed pipelines to export these resources to world markets. This energy wealth has funded rapid development in Baku and other urban areas, though rural regions often lag behind.

Like Armenia, Azerbaijan has been deeply affected by the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The loss of territory to Armenian forces in the 1990s led to hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis becoming internally displaced persons. The 2020 war allowed Azerbaijan to regain much of this territory.

Azerbaijan's political system has been criticized for authoritarianism. The Aliyev family has dominated politics since the Soviet era, with Heydar Aliyev and then his son Ilham Aliyev serving as presidents. Opposition groups face restrictions, and elections have been criticized by international observers.

## Ethnic Diversity and Conflict

The Caucasus is one of the world's most ethnically diverse regions, with dozens of distinct ethnic groups, languages, and cultures. This diversity has been both a source of cultural richness and a factor in conflicts.

### Ethnic Groups

The three Caucasus republics are each dominated by their titular ethnic groups: Georgians in Georgia, Armenians in Armenia, and Azerbaijanis in Azerbaijan. However, each country also has minority populations.

In Georgia, minorities include Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Russians, and smaller groups such as Ossetians and Abkhazians. Armenia is the most ethnically homogeneous of the three countries, with Armenians making up about 98% of the population. Azerbaijan's population is predominantly Azerbaijani, with minorities including Russians, Armenians (mostly in Nagorno-Karabakh), and various indigenous Caucasian peoples.

The region's ethnic diversity is reflected in its linguistic diversity. Georgian, Armenian, and Azerbaijani are the official languages of their respective countries, but many other languages are spoken as well. Georgian and Armenian each have their own unique alphabets, while Azerbaijani uses a modified Latin alphabet (it previously used Cyrillic during the Soviet period).

### Ethnic Conflicts

Ethnic tensions and conflicts have been a significant challenge for the Caucasus republics since independence. These conflicts have their roots in Soviet policies, historical grievances, and the complex ethnic geography of the region.

The most serious conflict has been over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan. The conflict began in the late Soviet period and escalated into full-scale war after independence. Despite a ceasefire in 1994, the conflict remained unresolved until fighting broke out again in 2020, resulting in significant territorial changes.

In Georgia, separatist movements in Abkhazia and South Ossetia led to conflicts in the early 1990s and again in 2008. These regions, with Russian support, function as de facto independent states, though they are recognized by few countries internationally.

These conflicts have had severe humanitarian consequences, including thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons. They have also hindered economic development and regional cooperation.

## Economic Challenges and Opportunities

The Caucasus republics face significant economic challenges but also have opportunities for development.

### Economic Challenges

All three countries experienced severe economic decline after the collapse of the Soviet Union, as Soviet-era economic links were disrupted and industries collapsed. They have since rebuilt their economies, but challenges remain:

1. **Isolation**: The region is relatively isolated, with limited access to global markets. Closed borders between Armenia and its neighbors Turkey and Azerbaijan further restrict trade.

2. **Corruption and Governance**: Corruption remains a significant issue in all three countries, though Georgia has made notable progress in fighting it. Weak institutions and governance problems hinder economic development.

3. **Inequality**: There are significant disparities between urban and rural areas, with cities (especially capitals) developing much faster than rural regions.

4. **Dependence on Specific Sectors**: Azerbaijan is heavily dependent on oil and gas, making it vulnerable to price fluctuations. Armenia and Georgia have more diverse but smaller economies.

### Economic Opportunities

Despite these challenges, the Caucasus republics have opportunities for economic development:

1. **Strategic Location**: The region lies at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, offering potential as a transit corridor for goods and energy resources.

2. **Tourism**: All three countries have rich cultural heritage and natural beauty that attract tourists. Georgia in particular has developed its tourism sector successfully.

3. **Agriculture**: The region has favorable conditions for agriculture, including wine production (especially in Georgia), fruit growing, and livestock raising.

4. **Energy Resources**: Azerbaijan's oil and gas reserves are a major asset, and the country has developed pipelines to export these resources to world markets. Armenia and Georgia have hydroelectric potential.

5. **Human Capital**: The region has relatively high education levels, a legacy of the Soviet system, which can support development in sectors such as information technology and services.

## International Relations

The Caucasus republics' international relations are shaped by their geographic location between Russia, Turkey, and Iran, as well as their historical ties and current interests.

### Relations with Russia

Russia remains a major influence in the Caucasus, though its relationships with the three republics differ significantly:

- Georgia has the most difficult relationship with Russia, particularly since the 2008 war. Georgia seeks closer ties with the West and views Russia as a threat to its sovereignty.

- Armenia has maintained close ties with Russia, which provides security guarantees and has a military base in the country. Russia is Armenia's main ally and trading partner.

- Azerbaijan has a more balanced approach, maintaining relations with Russia while also developing ties with Turkey and Western countries.

### Relations with Other Powers

The Caucasus republics have sought to develop relationships with other regional and global powers:

- Turkey has close cultural and linguistic ties with Azerbaijan ("one nation, two states") and has developed economic relations with Georgia. Its border with Armenia remains closed due to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and historical issues.

- Iran borders all three Caucasus republics and has historical and cultural ties to the region. It has particularly developed relations with Armenia, despite religious differences.

- The European Union has increased its engagement with the Caucasus through its Eastern Partnership program. Georgia in particular has sought closer integration with the EU.

- The United States has interests in the region related to energy resources, democracy promotion, and security. It has been particularly supportive of Georgia.

## Conclusion

The Caucasus republics—Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan—face significant challenges as they continue to develop as independent nations. Their complex histories, ethnic diversity, and strategic location have made them both culturally rich and politically volatile.

Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, these countries have worked to build new political systems, develop their economies, and establish their place in the international community. They have made progress in many areas, but continue to face challenges related to ethnic conflicts, economic development, and relations with neighboring powers.

The future of the Caucasus will depend on how these young nations address these challenges. Can they resolve or manage ethnic conflicts peacefully? Can they develop diverse and sustainable economies? Can they balance relations with Russia, Turkey, Iran, and Western powers? The answers to these questions will shape the region's development in the coming decades.

Despite the challenges, the Caucasus republics have shown resilience and determination in pursuing their national goals. Their rich cultural heritage, strategic location, and natural and human resources provide a foundation for future development and prosperity.
