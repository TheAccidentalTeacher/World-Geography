## If YOU lived there...
You are making a documentary about the Trans-Siberian Railway, a famous train that crosses the vast country of Russia. The train travels more than 5,700 miles across plains and mountains and through thick forests. As the train leaves the city of Moscow, you look out the window and see wheat fields and white birch trees.

## Physical Features

Have you ever stood on two continents at once? In Russia's Ural (YOOHR-uhl) Mountains, the continents of Europe and Asia meet. Europe lies to the west, Asia to the east. Together, Europe and Asia form the large landmass of Eurasia. On the map, you can see that a large chunk of Eurasia is the country of Russia. In fact, Russia is the world's largest country. Compared to the United States, Russia is almost twice as big.

Georgia, Armenia (ahr-MEE-nee-uh), and Azerbaijan (a-zuhr-by-JAHN) lie south of Russia in the Caucasus (KAW-kuh-suhs), the area between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. This area, which includes part of southern Russia, is named for the Caucasus Mountains.

### Landforms

Locate Russia on the physical map. As the map shows, Russia's landforms vary from west to east. The Northern European Plain stretches across western, or European, Russia. This fertile plain forms Russia's heartland, where most Russians live. Moscow, Russia's capital, is located there.

To the east, the plain rises to form the Ural Mountains. These mountains are not very high, but they are important because they mark the boundary between Europe and Asia. East of the Urals lies Siberia (sy-BIHR-ee-uh), a vast region that stretches all the way to the Pacific Ocean. Siberia makes up about three-fourths of Russia's territory, but it is home to only one-fourth of the country's people.

Siberia consists of the West Siberian Plain, the Central Siberian Plateau, and several mountain ranges. The West Siberian Plain is a vast, flat area of swamps and forests. The Central Siberian Plateau is a higher, more rugged region. Mountains rise along Russia's southern border and in the Russian Far East, the easternmost part of the country.

The Caucasus region is dominated by the Caucasus Mountains, which stretch between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. The Greater Caucasus range in the north includes Mount Elbrus, Europe's highest peak at 18,510 feet (5,642 meters). The Lesser Caucasus range lies to the south. Between the two ranges are valleys and plateaus where most people in the region live.

### Bodies of Water

Russia has many rivers and lakes. The Volga River, Europe's longest river, flows through western Russia into the Caspian Sea. The Volga has been important for transportation and trade throughout Russian history. Other major rivers in European Russia include the Don and the Dnieper (nee-PER).

In Siberia, several large rivers flow northward to the Arctic Ocean. These include the Ob, Yenisey (ye-nuh-SAY), and Lena rivers. These rivers are frozen for much of the year, which limits their usefulness for transportation. However, they provide water for drinking, irrigation, and hydroelectric power.

Russia also has many lakes. Lake Baikal (by-KAHL) in southern Siberia is the world's deepest lake and contains about one-fifth of Earth's fresh water. The Caspian Sea, which is actually a salt lake, forms part of Russia's southern border. It is the world's largest inland body of water.

The Caucasus region lies between the Black Sea to the west and the Caspian Sea to the east. These bodies of water have played important roles in the region's history, providing transportation routes and resources.

## Climate and Resources

Russia's climate is primarily continental, with long, cold winters and short, cool summers. However, the country's vast size means that climate conditions vary widely from region to region.

### Climate Factors

Several factors influence Russia's climate. One is latitude. Much of Russia lies far north, with some areas extending beyond the Arctic Circle. These northern regions receive little direct sunlight, especially in winter, when some areas experience weeks or even months of darkness.

Another factor is Russia's size and location. Most of Russia is far from the moderating influence of oceans, resulting in a continental climate with extreme temperatures. Winters are bitterly cold, especially in Siberia, where temperatures can drop to -40°F (-40°C) or lower. Summers are generally cool to mild, though some southern areas can get quite warm.

A third factor is elevation. Mountain ranges affect local climate conditions, with higher elevations experiencing colder temperatures and more precipitation.

The Caucasus region has a more varied climate than most of Russia. The mountains create different climate zones, from subtropical along the Black Sea coast to alpine in the high mountains. Generally, the Caucasus has milder winters and warmer summers than Russia.

### Natural Resources

Russia is rich in natural resources. It has some of the world's largest reserves of oil, natural gas, coal, and minerals. The country is a leading producer of oil and natural gas, which are found mainly in western Siberia and the Caspian Sea region. These energy resources are vital to Russia's economy and provide the country with significant export earnings.

Russia also has vast forests, which cover about half the country. The taiga, a belt of coniferous forest, stretches across much of Siberia and is one of the world's largest forests. These forests provide timber and wildlife habitat.

Water is another important resource. Russia's rivers generate hydroelectric power, and Lake Baikal and other freshwater sources provide drinking water. The country's fertile soils, especially in the Northern European Plain, support agriculture.

The Caucasus region also has significant natural resources. Azerbaijan has large oil and natural gas reserves, especially in and around the Caspian Sea. Georgia and Armenia have mineral deposits, forests, and fertile valleys suitable for agriculture.

### Challenges of Geography

Despite its wealth of resources, Russia faces several geographic challenges. One is the harsh climate, which makes agriculture difficult in many areas and increases the costs of construction, transportation, and heating. The long, cold winters also limit the growing season in much of the country.

Another challenge is the vast distances between resources and population centers. Many of Russia's natural resources are located in remote areas of Siberia, far from the major cities in the west. This makes resource extraction and transportation expensive and difficult.

A third challenge is permafrost, permanently frozen ground that underlies much of Siberia. Permafrost makes construction difficult and expensive, as buildings and infrastructure must be designed to prevent heat from melting the frozen ground beneath them.

The Caucasus region faces different challenges. The mountainous terrain makes transportation and communication difficult, isolating communities and hindering economic development. The region is also prone to earthquakes, which can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure.

## Human Adaptation

Despite these challenges, people in Russia and the Caucasus have adapted to their environments in various ways.

### Settlement Patterns

In Russia, most people live in the western part of the country, particularly in the Northern European Plain. This area has a milder climate, more fertile soil, and better access to transportation routes than the rest of the country. Moscow, Russia's capital and largest city, is located in this region.

Siberia, despite its vast size, is sparsely populated. Most settlements are located along the southern edge of the region, where the climate is less severe, or along rivers and the Trans-Siberian Railway, which provide transportation routes.

In the Caucasus, settlements are concentrated in valleys and plateaus between mountain ranges. The capitals of the three Caucasus countries—Tbilisi (Georgia), Yerevan (Armenia), and Baku (Azerbaijan)—are all located in areas with relatively favorable conditions for agriculture and transportation.

### Economic Activities

The physical geography of Russia and the Caucasus has shaped economic activities in the region. In Russia, agriculture is concentrated in the fertile plains of the west, where wheat, barley, and other crops are grown. Livestock raising is common in the steppe regions.

Resource extraction is a major economic activity, especially in Siberia. Oil and natural gas production, mining, and forestry provide jobs and export earnings. Manufacturing is concentrated in western Russia, particularly around Moscow and other major cities.

In the Caucasus, agriculture is important, with crops such as grapes, citrus fruits, and tea grown in the milder climate zones. Azerbaijan's economy is dominated by oil and natural gas production, while Georgia and Armenia have more diverse economies that include agriculture, mining, and services.

Tourism is growing in both Russia and the Caucasus, with visitors attracted by the regions' natural beauty, historical sites, and cultural attractions.

## Conclusion

The physical geography of Russia and the Caucasus has profoundly influenced human settlement, economic activities, and historical development in these regions. Russia's vast size, varied landforms, harsh climate, and abundant natural resources have shaped its development as a nation. The Caucasus, with its rugged mountains and strategic location between seas, has been a crossroads of cultures and a region of both conflict and cooperation.

Despite the challenges posed by their physical environments, the people of Russia and the Caucasus have adapted and built societies that reflect both their geographic circumstances and their cultural heritage. As these regions continue to develop in the 21st century, their physical geography will remain an important factor in shaping their futures.
