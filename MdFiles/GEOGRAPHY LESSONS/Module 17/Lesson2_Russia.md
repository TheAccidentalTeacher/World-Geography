## If YOU lived there...
It is 1992, an exciting time in your hometown of Moscow. At the end of 1991 the Soviet Union fell apart. Russia became independent. You watched on TV as people pulled down the red Soviet flag and knocked down statues of former leaders. Everyone is talking about new freedoms and a new kind of government.

**What new freedoms do you hope to have?**

## The Russian Empire

Russia's roots lie in the grassy, windswept plains of the steppe. For thousands of years, people from Asia moved across the steppe. These groups of people included the Slavs. As you may have read, the Slavs settled in Eastern Europe, including what is now Ukraine and western Russia.

### Early History and Empire

The Slavs developed towns and began trading with people from other areas. In the AD 800s, Viking traders from Scandinavia invaded the Slavs. These Vikings were called Rus (ROOS), and the word Russia probably comes from their name. The Vikings shaped the first Russian state among the Slavs. This Russian state, called Kievan (KEE-e-fuhn) Rus, centered around the city of Kiev. This city is now the capital of Ukraine.

Over time, missionaries introduced the Orthodox Christian faith to Kiev. In addition, the missionaries introduced a form of the Greek alphabet called Cyrillic (suh-RI-lik). The Russians adopted this Cyrillic alphabet and still use it today.

The alphabet is one of several factors that separate Russian, a Slavic language, from languages spoken in Europe such as French and Italian, which came from Latin. The Slavs came from Eastern Europe, not from the Roman Empire. In addition, the Russians were Orthodox Christians, not Roman Catholics. These differences helped shape Russia's identity as a nation that was neither fully European nor fully Asian.

In the 1200s, Mongol invaders from Central Asia conquered Kievan Rus. The Mongols ruled for about 200 years. During this time, a small settlement called Moscow grew into an important center. In the late 1400s, Moscow's ruler, Ivan III, drove out the Mongols and took the title of czar (ZAHR), or emperor. Ivan and later czars expanded Russian territory. By the late 1800s, the Russian Empire stretched from Eastern Europe to the Pacific Ocean.

### Revolution and Civil War

The Russian Empire was ruled by czars for hundreds of years. The czars had absolute power, and most Russians had few rights or freedoms. By the early 1900s, many Russians were unhappy with the czar's rule. They wanted political and economic reforms.

In 1914, Russia entered World War I, fighting against Germany and its allies. The war went badly for Russia, and conditions at home worsened. Food shortages and other hardships led to protests and strikes. In March 1917, Czar Nicholas II was forced to give up his throne. A temporary government took control.

Later that year the Bolsheviks (BOHL-shuh-viks), a radical Russian Communist group, seized power in the Russian Revolution. They then killed the czar and his family. In 1922 the Bolsheviks formed a new country, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), or the Soviet Union.

## The Soviet Union

The Soviet Union was a Communist state. Under communism, the government controls the economy and many aspects of people's lives. The Communist Party was the only legal political party in the Soviet Union, and its leaders had almost complete control over the country.

### Stalin's Rule

The most powerful Soviet leader was Joseph Stalin, who ruled from 1924 to 1953. Stalin transformed the Soviet Union from a mostly agricultural country into an industrial power. He forced peasants to give up their land and join large, state-run farms. He also built factories, power plants, and other industrial facilities.

Stalin's rule was brutal. He killed or imprisoned millions of people whom he saw as threats to his power. Many were sent to gulags (GOO-lagz), or prison camps, in Siberia. The prisoners were forced to work in harsh conditions, and many died.

Despite these horrors, the Soviet Union became a major world power under Stalin. During World War II (1939-1945), Soviet forces played a crucial role in defeating Nazi Germany, though at a terrible costâ€”about 20 million Soviet citizens died in the war.

### Cold War and Collapse

After World War II, tensions grew between the Soviet Union and the United States. This period, known as the Cold War, was marked by competition between the two superpowers in areas such as military strength, technology, and global influence. The Cold War lasted from the late 1940s until the early 1990s.

During this time, the Soviet Union controlled Eastern Europe and supported Communist movements around the world. It also competed with the United States in the space race, launching the first satellite (Sputnik) in 1957 and the first human into space (Yuri Gagarin) in 1961.

By the 1980s, however, the Soviet economy was struggling. The Communist system, with its central planning and lack of incentives, proved inefficient. Consumer goods were often scarce, and technology lagged behind the West.

In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became the Soviet leader. He introduced reforms aimed at restructuring the economy (perestroika) and increasing openness (glasnost). These reforms unleashed forces that Gorbachev could not control. People began demanding more freedom and independence.

In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. It broke apart into 15 independent countries, with Russia being the largest. Boris Yeltsin, who had been elected president of Russia in June 1991, became the leader of the new Russian Federation.

## Russian Culture

Russian culture has been shaped by the country's history, geography, and diverse population. It reflects both European and Asian influences, as well as the unique experiences of the Russian people.

### Religion and Language

Most Russians are Orthodox Christians, though decades of Communist rule weakened religious practice. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Orthodox Church has experienced a revival. Other religions practiced in Russia include Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism.

The Russian language is the country's official language and is spoken by most of its people. It uses the Cyrillic alphabet and is one of the world's major languages. Russia is also home to many minority languages, reflecting its ethnic diversity.

### Arts and Literature

Russia has a rich cultural heritage. Russian literature includes works by world-renowned authors such as Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Anton Chekhov. Russian music, from classical composers like Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky to folk songs, is also celebrated globally. The Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow is one of the world's premier ballet companies.

Russian art includes distinctive styles such as icon painting, which depicts religious figures and scenes. During the Soviet era, art was often used for propaganda purposes, promoting Communist ideals. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russian artists have enjoyed greater freedom of expression.

### Daily Life and Customs

Russian daily life has changed significantly since the Soviet era. Under communism, most people lived in small apartments in large, state-built housing blocks. Food and consumer goods were often scarce, and people had to wait in long lines to buy basic items.

Today, Russians have more consumer choices, though economic challenges remain. Many Russians still live in apartments, but those who can afford it may also have dachas (DAH-chuhz), or country houses, where they spend weekends and grow vegetables. Family is important in Russian culture, and multiple generations often live together or maintain close ties.

Russian cuisine reflects the country's harsh climate and agricultural traditions. Staple foods include bread, potatoes, cabbage, and beets. Popular dishes include borscht (beet soup), pelmeni (dumplings), and blini (pancakes). Tea is the national beverage, often served from a samovar, a traditional Russian tea urn.

## Russia Today

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has undergone significant changes. It has moved away from communism toward democracy and a market economy, though this transition has not been smooth.

### Government and Politics

Russia is officially a federal republic with a democratic constitution. The president is the head of state and has significant powers. The government includes a prime minister and cabinet, as well as a legislature (the Federal Assembly) with two houses: the State Duma and the Federation Council.

In practice, however, Russia's democracy has been limited. Vladimir Putin, who became president in 2000, has consolidated power and restricted political opposition and media freedom. Critics argue that Russia has become increasingly authoritarian under his leadership.

### Economy

Russia has transitioned from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, though the state still plays a significant role. The economy relies heavily on natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas. Russia is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of these commodities.

Other important sectors include agriculture, manufacturing, and services. However, Russia's economy faces challenges such as corruption, lack of diversification, and dependence on resource exports, which makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.

### Culture Regions

Russia's vast territory encompasses several distinct culture regions, each with its own characteristics:

1. **European Russia**: The western part of the country, including Moscow and St. Petersburg, is the most populous and developed region. It has strong cultural and economic ties to Europe.

2. **The Volga Region**: This area along the Volga River is ethnically diverse, with significant Tatar and other minority populations. It includes important industrial and agricultural areas.

3. **The Urals**: This region around the Ural Mountains is known for its mining and heavy industry. Cities like Yekaterinburg are major industrial centers.

4. **Siberia**: This vast region east of the Urals is rich in natural resources but sparsely populated. Major cities include Novosibirsk and Irkutsk.

5. **The Russian Far East**: The easternmost part of Russia, bordering the Pacific Ocean, includes cities like Vladivostok. It has economic ties to East Asian countries.

### Cities and Transportation

Russia's major cities reflect its history and development. Moscow, the capital, is the country's largest city and its political, economic, and cultural center. It features iconic landmarks such as the Kremlin, Red Square, and St. Basil's Cathedral.

St. Petersburg, founded by Peter the Great in 1703, was the imperial capital until the 1917 revolution. Known as Russia's "Window to the West," it has a more European character than other Russian cities, with beautiful palaces, museums, and canals.

Other important cities include Novosibirsk (Siberia's largest city), Yekaterinburg (a major industrial center), and Vladivostok (an important Pacific port).

Transportation is crucial in such a vast country. The Trans-Siberian Railway, completed in 1916, spans about 5,700 miles from Moscow to Vladivostok. It remains an important transportation link, though air travel has become more common for long-distance journeys. Russia also has extensive river transportation networks, particularly on the Volga and other major rivers.

## Challenges Facing Russia

Russia faces numerous challenges as it continues to develop in the 21st century.

### Demographic Crisis

Russia is experiencing a demographic crisis. Its population has been declining due to low birth rates, high death rates (particularly among men), and emigration. Life expectancy, especially for men, is lower than in most developed countries, partly due to high rates of alcoholism, smoking, and poor healthcare.

The government has implemented policies to encourage higher birth rates, such as financial incentives for families with children. It has also sought to attract Russian-speaking immigrants from former Soviet republics.

### Economic Challenges

Despite its natural resource wealth, Russia's economy faces significant challenges. It remains heavily dependent on oil and gas exports, making it vulnerable to price fluctuations. Efforts to diversify the economy have had limited success.

Other economic challenges include corruption, which discourages investment; inadequate infrastructure, particularly in remote areas; and international sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

### Political and Social Issues

Russia continues to struggle with building strong democratic institutions. Critics argue that political power is concentrated in the hands of President Putin and his allies, with limited checks and balances. Freedom of speech and press freedom have been restricted, and opposition figures have faced harassment and imprisonment.

Social issues include inequality, with significant disparities between wealthy urban elites and poorer rural populations. Ethnic tensions also exist in some regions, particularly in the North Caucasus, where separatist movements have led to conflict.

### International Relations

Russia's relations with Western countries have deteriorated in recent years, particularly after the annexation of Crimea and Russia's involvement in eastern Ukraine. Tensions with the United States and European Union remain high, with issues including election interference, cyber activities, and human rights concerns.

At the same time, Russia has strengthened ties with China and other non-Western powers. It seeks to maintain influence in former Soviet republics and to be recognized as a major global power.

## Conclusion

Russia's history, culture, and current situation reflect its unique position between Europe and Asia, its vast and challenging geography, and its complex political development. From the early days of Kievan Rus through the Russian Empire, the Soviet era, and the post-Soviet period, Russia has experienced dramatic changes while maintaining a distinct identity.

Today, Russia faces significant challenges, from demographic decline to economic diversification to political development. How it addresses these challenges will shape its future and its role in the world. Despite these difficulties, Russia remains a country of immense natural resources, rich cultural heritage, and global significance.
