## If YOU lived there...
For many years, your family has lived in a small village in southern Mexico. Jobs are scarce there. Your older brother and sisters talk about moving to a larger city. Big cities may provide some more opportunities, but they can be crowded and noisy. Many people from your village have already gone to the city.

**How do you feel about moving to the city?**

## Government

Today people in Mexico can vote in certain elections for the first time. People can find jobs in cities and buy their families a home. More children are able to attend school. In recent years, changes in Mexico's government and economy have made improvements like these possible.

Mexico has a democratic government. However, Mexico is not like the United States where different political parties have always competed for power. In Mexico the same political party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlled the government for 71 years. But this control ended in 2000 when Vicente Fox of the National Action Party (PAN) was elected president.

Mexico's government is a federal republic with three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The president is the head of the executive branch and is elected for a six-year term. The legislative branch consists of a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies. The judicial branch includes the Supreme Court and lower courts.

In the past, the PRI controlled all aspects of government, and elections were often unfair. However, reforms in the 1990s made elections more democratic. Today, all Mexican citizens age 18 and older can vote. Women gained the right to vote in 1953.

## Economy

Mexico's economy has grown significantly in recent decades, but it still faces challenges. The government has traditionally played a large role in the economy, owning and operating key industries such as oil production. However, since the 1980s, Mexico has moved toward a more market-based economy, privatizing many state-owned companies and opening up to international trade.

### Economic Challenges

One of the biggest challenges Mexico has faced is **inflation**, or a rise in prices. In the 1980s, inflation in Mexico reached very high levels, making it difficult for people to afford basic goods. The government implemented economic reforms to control inflation, but these reforms sometimes led to other problems, such as unemployment.

Another challenge is income inequality. While Mexico has a growing middle class, there is still a significant gap between the wealthy and the poor. Many Mexicans, especially in rural areas, live in poverty.

### Trade and Industry

Mexico's economy has become increasingly integrated with the global economy, particularly with the United States and Canada. In 1994, Mexico, the United States, and Canada implemented the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which eliminated most tariffs on trade between the three countries.

Mexico exports a variety of products, including manufactured goods, oil, agricultural products, and minerals. The United States is Mexico's largest trading partner, buying about 80 percent of Mexico's exports.

Manufacturing has become an important part of Mexico's economy. Many foreign companies have established factories in Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. These factories, known as **maquiladoras**, are particularly common along the U.S.-Mexico border. They assemble products using imported components, and then export the finished products, often to the United States.

### Agriculture

Agriculture remains an important sector of Mexico's economy, employing a significant portion of the workforce, especially in rural areas. Mexico produces a variety of crops, including corn, wheat, soybeans, rice, beans, cotton, coffee, and fruits and vegetables.

In some parts of Mexico, particularly in the south, farmers still use traditional methods such as **slash-and-burn agriculture**. This is a farming method in which farmers cut down and burn trees and vegetation to clear land for planting. After a few years, the soil becomes less fertile, and the farmers move to a new area, allowing the original area to regrow.

Many farmers in Mexico grow **cash crops**, which are crops grown primarily for sale rather than for the farmer's own use. Coffee, sugarcane, and fruits are important cash crops in Mexico. These crops are often grown for export.

## Culture Regions

Mexico can be divided into four distinct culture regions: Greater Mexico City, Central Mexico, Northern Mexico, and Southern Mexico. Each region has its own unique characteristics, influenced by factors such as geography, history, and economic development.

### Greater Mexico City

**Mexico City** is one of the largest cities in the world, with a metropolitan area that is home to more than 20 million people. The city is the political, economic, and cultural center of Mexico. It is located in the Valley of Mexico, a large valley in the high plateaus at the center of Mexico.

Mexico City faces several challenges due to its size and rapid growth. One of the most serious problems is air pollution. The city's location in a valley surrounded by mountains traps pollutants, creating **smog**, a type of air pollution that is a mixture of smoke and fog. The government has implemented measures to reduce pollution, such as restricting car use and improving public transportation, but air quality remains a concern.

Water scarcity is another challenge. Mexico City was built on the site of a former lake, and the city continues to sink as water is pumped from the aquifer beneath it. The city must import water from distant sources, and many residents, particularly in poorer neighborhoods, do not have reliable access to clean water.

Despite these challenges, Mexico City is a vibrant metropolis with a rich cultural life. It is home to numerous museums, theaters, and other cultural institutions. The historic center of the city, which includes the remains of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlán, is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

### Central Mexico

Central Mexico includes the states surrounding Mexico City. This region has a rich history and was the center of several pre-Columbian civilizations, including the Aztecs. Today, it is a mix of urban and rural areas, with a diverse economy that includes agriculture, manufacturing, and services.

The cities of central Mexico, such as Puebla and Querétaro, have grown rapidly in recent decades. Many of these cities have historic centers with colonial-era architecture, reflecting the region's Spanish heritage. These historic areas attract tourists and are important to the local economy.

Agriculture is also important in central Mexico. The region's fertile valleys support a variety of crops, including corn, beans, and vegetables. Many farmers in this region use modern agricultural methods, but traditional farming practices also persist.

### Northern Mexico

Northern Mexico is more closely tied to the United States than other parts of Mexico. The region has a drier climate than the rest of the country and includes large desert areas. The economy of northern Mexico is more industrialized than that of southern Mexico.

The maquiladora industry is particularly important in northern Mexico. Cities along the U.S.-Mexico border, such as Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, have many of these factories. The maquiladora industry has created jobs, but working conditions in some factories have been criticized.

Northern Mexico also has significant agricultural production, particularly in irrigated areas. The region produces a variety of crops, including wheat, cotton, and vegetables. Cattle ranching is also important in some parts of northern Mexico.

The culture of northern Mexico has been influenced by its proximity to the United States. American products, music, and other cultural elements are more common in northern Mexico than in other parts of the country.

### Southern Mexico

Southern Mexico is the least developed and most **indigenous** part of the country. Many people in this region are descendants of the Maya and other pre-Columbian peoples. Indigenous languages are still widely spoken in some areas.

Poverty is a significant issue in southern Mexico. Many people in the region are subsistence farmers, growing just enough food to feed their families. Others work on large plantations that grow cash crops such as coffee and sugarcane. Some farmers in the region still practice slash-and-burn agriculture.

Despite economic challenges, southern Mexico is rich in cultural traditions. Indigenous crafts, music, and festivals are important parts of the region's cultural life. The region also has many archaeological sites, including Maya ruins such as Palenque and Chichén Itzá, which attract tourists.

The Yucatán Peninsula, in southeastern Mexico, has seen significant development in recent decades due to tourism. The resort city of Cancún, with its beautiful beaches and clear waters, attracts millions of visitors each year. Tourism has created jobs and brought economic growth to the region, but it has also raised concerns about environmental impact and cultural preservation.

## Summary

Mexico has a democratic government and a growing economy. It also has distinct regions with different cultures, economies, and environments. Greater Mexico City is the country's political and economic center, but it faces challenges such as air pollution and water scarcity. Central Mexico has a mix of urban and rural areas, with a diverse economy. Northern Mexico is more industrialized and more closely tied to the United States. Southern Mexico is the least developed and most indigenous part of the country, but it is rich in cultural traditions and natural resources. As Mexico continues to develop, maintaining the country's unique regional cultures may be a challenge.
