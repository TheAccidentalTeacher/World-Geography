# Lesson 1: Physical Geography

## The Big Idea
Mexico is a large country with different natural environments in its northern, central, and southern regions.

## Main Ideas
- Mexico's physical features include plateaus, mountains, and coastal lowlands.
- Mexico's climate and vegetation include deserts, tropical forests, and cool highlands.
- Key natural resources in Mexico include oil, silver, gold, and scenic landscapes.

## Key Terms and Places
- Río Bravo (Rio Grande)
- peninsula
- Baja California
- Gulf of Mexico
- Yucatán Peninsula
- Sierra Madre

## If YOU lived there...
You live on Mexico's Pacific coast. Sunny weather and good beaches bring tourists year-round. Now you are on your way to visit a cousin in Puebla, in the highlands. To get there, you will have to take a bus along the winding roads of the steep Sierra Madre Occidental. This rugged mountain range runs along the coast. You have never been to the interior of Mexico before.

## Physical Features

Mexico, our neighbor to the south, shares a long border with the United States. Forming part of this border is one of Mexico's few major rivers, the **Río Bravo**. In the United States, this river is called the Rio Grande. At other places along the U.S.-Mexico border, it is impossible to tell where one country ends and the other country begins.

### Bodies of Water

Locate Mexico on the map and see that, except for its border with the United States, Mexico is mostly surrounded by water. Mexico's border in the west is the Pacific Ocean. Stretching south into the Pacific Ocean from northern Mexico is a narrow **peninsula**, or piece of land surrounded on three sides by water, called **Baja California**. To the east, Mexico's border is the **Gulf of Mexico**. The Gulf of Mexico is separated from the Caribbean Sea by a part of Mexico called the **Yucatán Peninsula**.

### Landforms

Mexico has a varied landscape. The country's interior is dominated by a large plateau. This plateau is bordered by mountain ranges on both the east and west. The **Sierra Madre** Occidental runs along the western edge of the plateau. The Sierra Madre Oriental runs along the eastern edge. A third mountain range, the Sierra Madre del Sur, runs along the southern Pacific coast.

Mexico's central plateau is higher in the south than in the north. Mexico City, the capital, is located in a high valley in the southern part of the plateau. The city sits at an elevation of about 7,350 feet (2,240 m) above sea level. That's higher than Denver, Colorado, which is known as the "Mile-High City" because it is about 5,280 feet (1,609 m) above sea level.

The mountains of Mexico include several volcanoes. Some of these volcanoes are active, meaning they could erupt at any time. Two of Mexico's highest peaks, Popocatépetl (poh-poh-kah-TEH-peht-l) and Iztaccíhuatl (ees-tahk-SEE-hwah-tl), are volcanoes located near Mexico City. Popocatépetl is active and occasionally sends clouds of ash and steam into the air.

The coastal plains of Mexico are narrow along the Pacific coast but wider along the Gulf coast. The Yucatán Peninsula is relatively flat and low-lying. It is made of limestone, a type of rock formed from the remains of ancient sea creatures. Over time, water has dissolved some of the limestone, creating underground caves and rivers.

## Climate and Vegetation

Mexico's climate varies widely from region to region. The country's location, elevation, and proximity to large bodies of water all affect its climate.

### Tropical and Subtropical Regions

Much of Mexico lies in the tropics, the region of Earth between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The tropics generally have warm temperatures year-round. However, elevation can significantly affect temperature. In Mexico, higher elevations tend to have cooler temperatures than lower elevations at the same latitude.

The coastal plains along the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea have a tropical climate with high temperatures and abundant rainfall. These areas are hot and humid throughout the year. The Yucatán Peninsula has a tropical climate in the south, where there are dense rainforests. The northern part of the peninsula is drier, with scrub forests and grasslands.

The Pacific coastal plain also has a tropical climate, but it is generally drier than the Gulf coast. The southern Pacific coast receives more rainfall than the northern Pacific coast.

### Highland Regions

The central plateau of Mexico has a more temperate climate due to its higher elevation. The southern part of the plateau, where Mexico City is located, has mild temperatures year-round. Despite being in the tropics, Mexico City can sometimes experience freezing temperatures due to its high elevation.

The northern part of the plateau is drier and has greater temperature extremes. Summers can be very hot, and winters can be quite cold. This region includes some desert areas.

The mountain ranges of Mexico have cooler temperatures than the surrounding lowlands. The highest peaks are covered with snow year-round. The mountains also create rain shadows, areas of reduced rainfall on the leeward (downwind) side of the mountains. This effect contributes to the dryness of the northern plateau.

### Vegetation Zones

Mexico's diverse climates support a variety of vegetation zones. The tropical coastal plains and the southern Yucatán Peninsula are home to lush rainforests. These forests contain a rich diversity of plant and animal species.

The central highlands have a mix of forests and grasslands. Pine and oak forests are common at higher elevations. As elevation increases, the forests give way to alpine meadows and, at the highest elevations, bare rock and snow.

In the drier northern regions, the vegetation consists of desert plants such as cacti and other succulents, which are adapted to conserve water. The northern part of the Yucatán Peninsula also has drier conditions, and the vegetation there is scrub forest.

Like the Yucatán Peninsula in the south, most of northern Mexico is dry. The deserts in Baja California and the northern part of the plateau get little rainfall. Desert plants and dry grasslands are common in the north. Cougars, coyotes, and deer live in some areas of the desert.

## Natural Resources

Mexico is rich in natural resources. One of its most important resources is petroleum, or oil. Oil reserves are found mainly under the southern and Gulf coastal plains as well as offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Mexico sells much of its oil to the United States.

Before oil was discovered in Mexico, minerals were the country's most valuable resource. Some gold and silver mines that were begun many centuries ago are still in operation. In addition, new mines have been developed in Mexico's mountains. Today, Mexico's mines produce more silver than any other country in the world. Mexican mines also yield large amounts of copper, gold, lead, and zinc.

Another important resource is water. The refreshing water surrounding Mexico draws many tourists to the country's scenic beaches. Unfortunately, drinking water is limited in many parts of Mexico. Water scarcity is a serious issue.

## Summary

The natural environments of Mexico range from arid plateaus in the north to humid, forested mountains in the south. Mexico's physical features include plateaus, mountains, and coastal lowlands. The country's climate varies widely, from hot and humid tropical regions to cool highland areas. Mexico is rich in natural resources, including oil, silver, gold, and scenic landscapes.
