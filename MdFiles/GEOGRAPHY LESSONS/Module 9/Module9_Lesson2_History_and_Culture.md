## If YOU lived there...
You belong to one of the native Indian peoples in southern Mexico in the early 1500s. Years ago, the Aztec rulers went to war against your people. They took many captives. They have always treated you cruelly. Now some strangers have come from across the sea. They want your people to help them conquer the Aztecs.

**Will you help the strangers fight the Aztecs? Why or why not?**

## Early Cultures

People first came to Mexico many thousands of years ago. As early as 5,000 years ago, they were growing beans, peppers, and squash. They also domesticated an early form of corn. Farming allowed these people to build the first permanent settlements in the Americas.

### Olmec

By about 1500 BC the Olmec people in Mexico were living in small villages. The Olmec lived on the humid southern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, where they built temples and giant statues. They also traded carved stones like jade and obsidian with other cultures in eastern Mexico.

### Maya

The Maya civilization developed in southern Mexico and Central America. The Maya built large cities with stone temples and palaces. They were skilled mathematicians and astronomers who developed a complex calendar. They also created a writing system using hieroglyphs, or picture symbols.

The Maya civilization reached its peak between AD 300 and 900. Then, for reasons that scholars still debate, the Maya abandoned many of their cities. Some think that drought, disease, or warfare may have caused the decline. By the time the Spanish arrived in the 1500s, the great Maya cities were already in ruins, though Maya people still lived in the region.

### Aztecs

The Aztecs were the last great civilization to develop in Mexico before the arrival of Europeans. They built their capital city, Tenochtitlán (teh-nawch-teet-LAHN), on an island in Lake Texcoco in central Mexico. Today, Mexico City stands on the site of this ancient Aztec capital.

The Aztecs created a powerful **empire**, or a group of territories and peoples controlled by one ruler. They conquered neighboring peoples and demanded tribute, or payment, from them. The Aztecs also practiced human sacrifice as part of their religion. They believed that the gods needed human blood to keep the sun moving across the sky.

## Spanish Colonization

In 1519, Spanish explorer Hernán Cortés landed on the coast of Mexico with about 600 men. The Aztec ruler, Moctezuma II, at first welcomed Cortés and his men. However, relations between the Spanish and Aztecs soon deteriorated.

### Conquest

Cortés and his men, known as **conquistadors**, or conquerors, marched to Tenochtitlán. They were joined by thousands of native allies who resented Aztec rule. The Spanish had several advantages over the Aztecs, including horses, steel weapons, and gunpowder. They also unknowingly brought diseases like smallpox, which killed many Aztecs who had no immunity to these European diseases.

After a long siege, the Spanish and their allies conquered Tenochtitlán in 1521. The fall of the Aztec capital marked the beginning of Spanish rule in Mexico, which would last for nearly 300 years.

### Colonial Society

The Spanish established a colonial society in Mexico with a rigid social hierarchy. At the top were people born in Spain, followed by criollos (creoles), who were people of Spanish descent born in the Americas. Below them were **mestizos**, people of mixed Spanish and Indian ancestry, and **mulattoes**, people of mixed Spanish and African ancestry. At the bottom of the social scale were Indians and enslaved Africans.

The Spanish established **missions**, or religious settlements, to convert the native peoples to Christianity. They also created **haciendas**, or large estates, where Indians and mestizos worked as laborers. The Spanish introduced new crops, animals, and technologies to Mexico, but they also exploited the native population and extracted wealth from the land.

## Independence and After

By the early 1800s, many people in Mexico were dissatisfied with Spanish rule. The ideas of the American and French Revolutions, which emphasized liberty and equality, had spread to Mexico. In addition, the criollos resented their second-class status compared to those born in Spain.

### Independence Movement

In 1810, Miguel Hidalgo, a Catholic priest, called for independence from Spain. His cry for freedom, known as the Grito de Dolores, is celebrated as the beginning of Mexico's independence movement. Although Hidalgo was captured and executed, others continued the fight for independence.

Mexico finally gained independence from Spain in 1821. However, the new nation faced many challenges. Over the next several decades, Mexico experienced political instability, foreign interventions, and territorial losses. In 1848, after the Mexican-American War, Mexico was forced to cede a vast territory to the United States, including what is now California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming.

### Reform and Revolution

In the mid-1800s, Benito Juárez, a Zapotec Indian who became president of Mexico, introduced a series of liberal reforms known as La Reforma. These reforms aimed to reduce the power of the Catholic Church and the military, and to promote equality before the law.

In the early 1900s, Mexico experienced a violent revolution. The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) was a complex conflict involving various factions with different goals. Some wanted political democracy, others sought land reform, and still others fought for workers' rights. The revolution resulted in a new constitution in 1917, which included provisions for land reform, workers' rights, and limits on the power of the Catholic Church.

## Mexican Culture Today

Mexican culture today reflects the country's rich history and diverse influences. It is a blend of indigenous traditions and Spanish colonial heritage, with some modern global influences as well.

### Language and Religion

Spanish is the official language of Mexico, a legacy of the colonial period. However, many indigenous languages are still spoken, especially in rural areas. The government recognizes 68 indigenous languages as national languages.

The vast majority of Mexicans are Roman Catholic, another legacy of Spanish colonization. However, many Mexican Catholics incorporate indigenous beliefs and practices into their religious observances, creating a unique form of folk Catholicism.

### Art and Architecture

Mexican art has a long and distinguished history, from the monumental sculptures of the Olmec to the murals of modern artists like Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. Mexican architecture also reflects the country's diverse influences, from pre-Columbian pyramids to Spanish colonial churches to modern skyscrapers.

After the Mexican Revolution, a group of artists known as the muralists, including Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros, created large public murals that celebrated Mexican history and culture. These murals often depicted the struggles of ordinary Mexicans and criticized social injustice.

### Food and Celebrations

Mexican cuisine is known for its bold flavors, colorful presentations, and variety of ingredients. Traditional Mexican dishes include tacos, enchiladas, tamales, and mole, a complex sauce made with chocolate and chili peppers. Many Mexican dishes incorporate ingredients that have been used since pre-Columbian times, such as corn, beans, and chili peppers.

Mexicans celebrate many festivals and holidays throughout the year. Some, like Christmas and Easter, are Catholic holidays brought by the Spanish. Others, like the Day of the Dead (Día de los Muertos), combine Catholic and indigenous traditions.

The Day of the Dead is celebrated on November 1 and 2, coinciding with the Catholic observances of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day. During this holiday, Mexicans honor their deceased loved ones by creating altars with offerings of food, drink, and personal items. They also visit cemeteries to clean and decorate graves with flowers and candles.

Unlike many cultures that view death with fear or sadness, during Day of the Dead, Mexicans celebrate death as part of life. This attitude comes from the Mexican Indian belief that the souls of the dead return every year to visit their living relatives. The holiday reflects both native customs and Catholic beliefs about life after death.

## Summary

Mexico's early cultures formed great civilizations, but after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, power in Mexico shifted to Spain. Spain ruled Mexico for nearly 300 years before Mexico gained independence. Mexico's history and its mix of Indian and Spanish backgrounds have influenced the country's culture, creating a rich and diverse heritage that continues to evolve today.
