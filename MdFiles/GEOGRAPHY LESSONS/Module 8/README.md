## Essential Question
Throughout this module, consider: **Which early Latin American civilization was most successful?**

As you study these civilizations, think about what criteria might be used to judge "success" - territorial expansion, longevity, cultural achievements, engineering feats, social organization, or other factors. Each civilization had remarkable accomplishments and faced significant challenges, providing rich material for comparison and analysis.
