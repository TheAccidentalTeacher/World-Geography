## Geography and Early Andean Civilizations

As the Olmec, the Maya, and the Aztecs developed in Mesoamerica, other civilizations developed in South America. A series of cultures rose and fell in the Andes Mountains and along the Pacific coast of South America. These cultures were influenced by the geography of the region in which they lived.

### The Geography of the Andes

The towering Andes Mountains run along the western side of South America. High plains, or altiplano, sit between mountain ridges. A narrow desert runs along the edge of rich fishing waters in the Pacific Ocean. Rivers run from the Andes to the Pacific through the dry region. Other rivers drain into the Amazon River system to the east.

Climate varies with latitude and altitude. Higher altitudes are generally colder. Areas closer to the equator are generally warmer. Within this region, many civilizations grew, adapting to the land around them.

### Early Andean Civilizations

Several important civilizations developed in the Andean region before the rise of the Inca Empire:

#### Chavín (900-200 BCE)

The Chavín culture, centered at Chavín de Huántar in the northern highlands of Peru, was one of the earliest complex societies in the Andes. The Chavín are known for their distinctive art style, which featured images of jaguars, eagles, and other animals, often with anthropomorphic (human-like) features. They built impressive stone temples and developed sophisticated techniques for working with gold and other metals.

The Chavín culture had a significant influence on later Andean civilizations, particularly in terms of religious iconography and architectural techniques. Their religious center at Chavín de Huántar attracted pilgrims from throughout the region, helping to spread their cultural influence.

#### Nazca (100 BCE-800 CE)

The Nazca culture developed on the arid southern coast of Peru. They are famous for creating the Nazca Lines, enormous geoglyphs (ground drawings) etched into the desert floor. These lines depict various animals, plants, and geometric shapes, and are so large that they can only be fully appreciated from the air. The purpose of these lines remains a subject of debate among archaeologists, with theories ranging from astronomical calendars to religious rituals.

The Nazca also produced fine polychrome pottery with distinctive designs and colors. They developed sophisticated irrigation systems that allowed them to farm in the desert environment, channeling water from the Andes through a system of underground aqueducts called puquios.

#### Moche (100-700 CE)

The Moche civilization flourished on the northern coast of Peru. They built impressive adobe (mud brick) pyramids, including the Huaca del Sol (Temple of the Sun) and Huaca de la Luna (Temple of the Moon) near modern-day Trujillo. The Moche were skilled metalworkers who created intricate gold, silver, and copper objects.

Moche pottery is particularly notable for its realism and variety. Their ceramic vessels often depict scenes from daily life, portraits of individuals, and religious or mythological themes. Some Moche pottery shows explicit sexual scenes, which may have had religious significance.

The Moche society was highly stratified, with a powerful elite controlling religious and political life. Evidence suggests that they practiced human sacrifice as part of their religious rituals.

#### Tiwanaku (300-1000 CE)

The Tiwanaku civilization developed around Lake Titicaca in the altiplano region of Bolivia and Peru. Their capital city, also called Tiwanaku, was a major urban center with monumental stone architecture, including temples, palaces, and a distinctive semi-subterranean temple with carved stone heads embedded in the walls.

The Tiwanaku developed advanced agricultural techniques to farm the challenging high-altitude environment. They created raised fields called sukakollos, which helped manage water and protect crops from frost. These techniques allowed them to support a large population in an area where agriculture would otherwise be difficult.

The Tiwanaku influence spread throughout the southern Andes through trade, colonization, and possibly military conquest. Their artistic style and religious concepts influenced many contemporary and later Andean cultures.

#### Chimú (900-1470 CE)

The Chimú Empire, centered at their capital Chan Chan on the northern coast of Peru, was the largest pre-Inca state in the region. Chan Chan was one of the largest adobe cities in the world, covering nearly 20 square kilometers. The city was divided into citadels, or walled compounds, each of which was built by a different ruler.

The Chimú were skilled engineers who built extensive irrigation systems to water their crops in the desert environment. They were also accomplished metalworkers, particularly in gold and silver, creating intricate jewelry and ceremonial objects.

The Chimú Empire was eventually conquered by the Inca in the late 15th century, shortly before the arrival of the Spanish. Many Chimú artistic and architectural techniques were adopted by the Inca.

## The Inca Empire

The Inca created the largest empire in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans. At its height, the Inca Empire stretched along the western side of South America from present-day Ecuador to central Chile, covering an area of about 770,000 square miles.

### The Rise of the Inca

According to Inca legend, their first ruler, Manco Capac, was sent by the sun god Inti to bring civilization to humanity. He founded the city of Cuzco in the high Andes of Peru, which became the capital of the Inca Empire.

For several centuries, the Inca remained a small kingdom centered around Cuzco. Their expansion began in the early 15th century under the ruler Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui, who is often compared to Alexander the Great for his military conquests. Pachacuti reorganized the Inca state, established many of the administrative systems that would characterize the empire, and began the conquest of neighboring peoples.

Pachacuti's son Topa Inca Yupanqui continued the expansion, conquering the powerful Chimú Empire on the northern coast of Peru and extending Inca control into present-day Ecuador, Bolivia, and parts of Chile and Argentina. By the early 16th century, the Inca Empire, known as Tawantinsuyu ("Land of the Four Quarters"), was the largest state in the Americas.

### Inca Government and Administration

The Inca Empire was a highly centralized state with a complex administrative system. At the top was the Sapa Inca, or emperor, who was considered divine, a descendant of the sun god Inti. The position was hereditary, passing from father to son.

The empire was divided into four quarters, each governed by a high official who was usually a close relative of the Sapa Inca. These quarters were further divided into provinces and districts, each with its own administrators. Local rulers who submitted peacefully to Inca authority were often allowed to maintain their positions, though under Inca supervision.

The Inca developed an elaborate system of record-keeping using quipus, knotted cords that recorded numerical information. Quipu keepers, or quipucamayocs, used these devices to keep track of population figures, tax obligations, agricultural production, and other important data.

The Inca imposed their language, Quechua, throughout the empire. They also established a state religion centered on the worship of the sun god Inti, although they generally allowed conquered peoples to continue worshipping their own gods as long as they also acknowledged the Inca deities.

### Infrastructure and Engineering

One of the most impressive achievements of the Inca was their extensive road network, which covered more than 18,000 miles. These roads connected all parts of the empire, from the high Andes to the coastal regions. The main highways were paved with stone and included bridges, tunnels, and steps cut into mountainsides. Way stations called tambos were placed at regular intervals along the roads, providing rest and supplies for travelers, particularly official messengers who carried information throughout the empire.

The Inca were master stonemasons who built impressive structures without the use of mortar. They cut stones so precisely that they fit together perfectly, creating walls that have withstood centuries of earthquakes. Their buildings, terraces, and other structures were designed to harmonize with the natural landscape.

The Inca also developed sophisticated agricultural techniques to farm the challenging Andean environment. They built extensive terraces on steep mountainsides to create flat land for farming and to prevent soil erosion. They constructed irrigation systems to bring water to crops and developed freeze-drying techniques to preserve food for storage.

## Life in the Inca Empire

The Inca Empire was a complex society with a distinct social structure, religious practices, and cultural achievements.

### Social Structure

Inca society was highly stratified, with clear divisions between social classes:

1. **Sapa Inca and Royal Family**: At the top of Inca society was the Sapa Inca, or emperor, and his family. The Sapa Inca was considered divine and had absolute power. He lived in luxury and was carried on a golden litter when he traveled.

2. **Nobility**: Below the royal family were the nobles, who served as government officials, military leaders, and priests. The highest-ranking nobles were relatives of the Sapa Inca. Lower-ranking nobles included the curacas, or local chiefs who had submitted to Inca rule.

3. **Commoners**: Most people in the Inca Empire were commoners who worked as farmers, herders, artisans, or servants. They lived in simple houses and had to provide labor service, called mit'a, to the state. This labor was used for building roads, bridges, terraces, irrigation systems, and other public works.

4. **Yanaconas**: At the bottom of society were the yanaconas, or servants, who worked permanently for the state, the temples, or noble families. They were not exactly slaves, as they could not be bought or sold, but they had few rights and could not leave their service.

### Economy and Labor

The Inca economy was based on agriculture, herding, and tribute. Farmers grew crops such as maize (corn), potatoes, quinoa, and other Andean grains and vegetables. They also raised llamas and alpacas for meat, wool, and as pack animals.

Land in the Inca Empire was divided into three parts: one for the state, one for the religious establishment, and one for the communities. Commoners worked all three types of land as part of their labor obligations. The produce from state and religious lands supported the government, the military, and religious institutions.

The Inca practiced a form of wealth redistribution. The state collected and stored agricultural products and other goods in storehouses throughout the empire. These supplies were used to support the army, government officials, and people in need during times of famine or natural disaster.

Trade was less important in the Inca economy than in many other ancient civilizations. The Inca did not use money; instead, they relied on barter and state-controlled distribution of goods. However, luxury items such as gold, silver, fine textiles, and exotic feathers were traded among the elite.

### Religion and Ritual

Religion was central to Inca life and was closely connected to the state. The Inca believed in many gods associated with natural forces and celestial bodies. The most important deity was Inti, the sun god, who was considered the ancestor of the Inca rulers. Other important gods included Viracocha, the creator god; Illapa, the weather god; and Pachamama, the earth goddess.

The Inca built impressive temples throughout their empire, the most important being the Coricancha, or Temple of the Sun, in Cuzco. This temple was covered with gold and contained golden statues and other treasures. Religious ceremonies were conducted by priests and included offerings of food, drink, textiles, and sometimes animals.

Human sacrifice was practiced in the Inca Empire, though less frequently than among the Aztecs. The most important sacrifice was the capacocha, in which children were sacrificed on mountain tops. These children were selected for their physical perfection and were considered messengers to the gods rather than victims.

The Inca calendar was based on both solar and lunar observations. Important festivals were held throughout the year, often coinciding with agricultural cycles or celestial events. The most important festival was Inti Raymi, the festival of the sun, which celebrated the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere (June 21-24).

### Cultural Achievements

The Inca made significant achievements in various fields:

1. **Architecture**: The Inca were master builders who constructed impressive cities, temples, fortresses, and agricultural terraces. Their most famous architectural achievement is Machu Picchu, a city built on a mountain ridge that was likely a royal estate or religious retreat. Inca buildings were constructed with precisely cut stones that fit together without mortar, a technique that has allowed many structures to survive for centuries despite earthquakes.

2. **Engineering**: The Inca built an extensive road network spanning over 18,000 miles, with bridges, tunnels, and stairways to overcome the challenging Andean terrain. They also constructed sophisticated irrigation systems and agricultural terraces.

3. **Textiles**: Inca textiles were highly valued and considered more precious than gold or silver. They were made from cotton or the wool of llamas, alpacas, and vicuñas. Inca weavers created intricate designs with vibrant colors. Textiles were used for clothing, as gifts to cement political alliances, and as sacrificial offerings.

4. **Metalwork**: The Inca were skilled metalworkers who created objects of gold, silver, and copper. They used techniques such as hammering, repoussé (creating raised designs), and lost-wax casting. Gold was particularly important because of its association with the sun god Inti.

5. **Medicine**: Inca physicians had extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and surgical techniques. They performed successful skull surgeries (trepanation) and used coca leaves (from which cocaine is derived) as a local anesthetic. They also used splints for broken bones and treated various ailments with herbal remedies.

6. **Agriculture**: The Inca developed advanced agricultural techniques to farm in the challenging Andean environment. They created thousands of varieties of potatoes adapted to different altitudes and climates. They also domesticated other crops such as quinoa, maize, and various beans.

## The Spanish Conquest

The Inca Empire came to an abrupt end with the arrival of Spanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro in the 1530s.

### Pizarro Arrives in Peru

Francisco Pizarro first explored the northern coast of Peru in 1526-1527. After seeing evidence of the Inca Empire's wealth, he returned to Spain to obtain royal permission for a conquest expedition. In 1532, he returned to Peru with about 180 men and 37 horses.

Pizarro's arrival coincided with a civil war within the Inca Empire. The Sapa Inca Huayna Capac had died in an epidemic (likely smallpox brought by earlier European contact) around 1527. His death led to a succession struggle between his sons Huáscar and Atahualpa. By 1532, Atahualpa had defeated Huáscar but had not yet consolidated his power.

### The Capture of Atahualpa

In November 1532, Pizarro and his men reached the Andean town of Cajamarca, where Atahualpa was camped with his army. Pizarro invited Atahualpa to meet with him in the town square. When Atahualpa arrived with a large unarmed retinue, the Spanish launched a surprise attack. Using their superior weapons—steel swords, armor, and horses—they killed thousands of Inca and captured Atahualpa.

Atahualpa, hoping to secure his release, offered to fill a large room once with gold and twice with silver. The Spanish accepted this ransom, and over the next few months, the Inca brought enormous quantities of gold and silver objects from throughout the empire. Despite receiving the ransom, Pizarro had Atahualpa executed in July 1533, fearing that he was organizing a resistance movement.

### The Fall of Cuzco

After Atahualpa's death, Pizarro installed a puppet ruler, Túpac Huallpa, who died shortly thereafter. The Spanish then marched on Cuzco, the Inca capital, which they captured in November 1533. They installed another puppet ruler, Manco Inca, a son of Huayna Capac.

Initially, Manco Inca cooperated with the Spanish, but in 1536, he escaped from Cuzco and led a massive rebellion against the conquistadors. The Inca besieged Cuzco for several months but were ultimately unable to recapture the city. Manco Inca retreated to Vilcabamba, a remote region in the Andes, where he established a neo-Inca state that resisted Spanish control until 1572.

### The Aftermath of Conquest

The Spanish conquest had devastating consequences for the Inca and other indigenous peoples of the Andes. European diseases, to which the native peoples had no immunity, caused a demographic catastrophe. The population of the Andean region declined dramatically in the decades following the conquest.

The Spanish imposed their language, religion, and political system on the indigenous population. They established an encomienda system, in which Spanish colonists were granted land and the right to demand tribute and labor from the native inhabitants. They also forced indigenous people to work in silver and gold mines under harsh conditions.

However, elements of Inca culture survived and blended with Spanish influences to create the mestizo culture of modern Peru and other Andean countries. Quechua, the language of the Inca, is still spoken by millions of people in the Andes today. Inca agricultural practices, foods, textiles, and artistic traditions continue to influence Andean culture.

## Conclusion

The Andean region of South America was home to a succession of sophisticated civilizations before the rise of the Inca Empire. These early cultures, including the Chavín, Nazca, Moche, Tiwanaku, and Chimú, developed advanced agricultural techniques, impressive architectural and engineering skills, and distinctive artistic traditions.

The Inca built upon these foundations to create the largest empire in pre-Columbian America. Their achievements in architecture, engineering, agriculture, textiles, and administration were remarkable, especially considering that they accomplished all this without writing, the wheel, or draft animals (other than llamas, which could carry only light loads).

The Inca Empire came to an end with the Spanish conquest led by Francisco Pizarro in the 1530s. The conquest had profound and lasting effects on the indigenous population and led to the establishment of Spanish colonial rule in the Andes. Despite the destruction of their empire, aspects of Inca culture have survived and continue to influence Andean societies today.

The rise and fall of the Inca Empire represents a significant chapter in the history of the Americas, demonstrating both the remarkable achievements and the tragic vulnerabilities of pre-Columbian civilizations in the face of European expansion.
