## The Aztecs Build an Empire

The first Aztecs were farmers who migrated from the north to central Mexico. Finding the good farmland already occupied, they settled on a swampy island in the middle of Lake Texcoco (tays-KOH-koh). There, in 1325, they began building their capital and conquering nearby towns.

### The Founding of Tenochtitlán

According to Aztec legend, their god Huitzilopochtli (wee-tsee-loh-POHCH-tlee) told them to build a city where they saw an eagle perched on a cactus with a snake in its beak. When they saw this sign on an island in Lake Texcoco, they founded their capital city, Tenochtitlán (teh-noch-teet-LAHN).

The Aztecs turned a swampy, uninhabited island into a magnificent city. They built artificial islands called chinampas by piling soil on reed mats anchored to the lake bottom. These "floating gardens" provided fertile land for growing crops. They connected the islands with canals for transportation by canoe.

As the city grew, the Aztecs built causeways, or raised roads, connecting the island to the mainland. They constructed aqueducts to bring fresh water from springs on the mainland. By the early 1500s, Tenochtitlán had grown into one of the world's largest cities, with a population of about 200,000 people.

### The Growth of the Aztec Empire

The Aztecs began as a small, weak group surrounded by powerful neighbors. To survive, they served as mercenaries (hired soldiers) for stronger states. Over time, they built up their military strength and formed alliances with other city-states.

Under a series of ambitious rulers, the Aztecs began to conquer neighboring peoples. By the early 1500s, they had built an empire that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean and included much of central and southern Mexico.

The Aztec Empire was not a centralized state but a collection of conquered territories that paid tribute to the Aztecs. Conquered peoples had to provide the Aztecs with goods such as gold, cotton, cacao (chocolate), and warriors for sacrifice. Local rulers could remain in power as long as they acknowledged Aztec supremacy and paid their tribute.

## Life in the Aztec Empire

The Aztec Empire was a complex society with a distinct social structure, religious practices, and cultural achievements.

### Social Structure

Aztec society was highly stratified, with clear divisions between social classes:

1. **Emperor**: At the top of Aztec society was the emperor, or huey tlatoani ("great speaker"). The emperor was considered divine and had absolute power. He lived in a magnificent palace and was treated with extreme reverence.

2. **Nobles**: Below the emperor were the nobles, who served as government officials, priests, and military leaders. They owned land and lived in large houses.

3. **Commoners**: Most Aztecs were commoners who worked as farmers, artisans, or merchants. They lived in simple houses and had fewer rights than nobles, but they could improve their status through military achievements or commerce.

4. **Serfs and Slaves**: At the bottom of society were serfs, who were bound to the land they worked, and slaves. Slaves were often prisoners of war or people who had sold themselves into slavery to pay debts. Unlike in some other societies, slavery was not hereditary in Aztec society, and slaves could buy their freedom.

### Religion and Warfare

Religion was central to Aztec life and was closely connected to warfare. The Aztecs believed in many gods who controlled different aspects of nature and human life. They believed that the gods had sacrificed themselves to create the world and that human sacrifice was necessary to repay this debt and keep the universe functioning.

The Aztecs practiced human sacrifice on a large scale. Captives taken in war were the primary victims of sacrifice. The Aztecs believed that the hearts and blood of sacrificial victims nourished the gods, particularly the sun god Huitzilopochtli, who needed human blood to continue his daily journey across the sky.

War was a key factor in the Aztecs' rise to power. The Aztecs fought not only to expand their empire but also to capture prisoners for sacrifice. Young Aztec men were trained for war from an early age, and military service was the main way for commoners to gain status and wealth.

### Economy and Trade

The Aztec economy was based on agriculture, tribute, and trade. Farmers grew crops such as maize (corn), beans, squash, and chili peppers on chinampas and terraced fields. They also raised turkeys and dogs for meat and kept bees for honey.

Tribute from conquered territories was a major source of wealth for the Aztec economy. The Aztecs also controlled a huge trade network. Merchants, known as pochteca, traveled throughout Mesoamerica trading Aztec goods for luxury items like jade, gold, exotic feathers, and cacao.

The Aztecs used several forms of currency, including cacao beans and standardized cotton cloaks called quachtli. They held regular markets where people could buy and sell goods. The main market in Tenochtitlán, located in the neighboring city of Tlatelolco, was one of the largest in the world, with tens of thousands of people trading daily.

### Daily Life

Daily life for most Aztecs revolved around agriculture and household tasks. Men worked in the fields, hunted, and fished, while women prepared food, made clothing, and cared for children. Children began helping with household tasks at a young age and received both practical and formal education.

The Aztecs ate a varied diet based on maize, beans, and squash, supplemented with meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables. They drank pulque, a fermented beverage made from the maguey plant, and chocolate, which was reserved for the nobility and warriors.

Housing varied by social class. Nobles lived in large stone or adobe houses with multiple rooms arranged around a central courtyard. Commoners lived in smaller, simpler houses made of adobe or wattle-and-daub (a mixture of twigs, straw, and mud).

### Cultural Achievements

The Aztecs made significant achievements in various fields:

1. **Architecture**: The Aztecs built impressive structures, including pyramids, temples, palaces, and ball courts. The Great Temple (Templo Mayor) in Tenochtitlán was a massive pyramid with two temples on top, one dedicated to Huitzilopochtli and the other to Tlaloc, the rain god.

2. **Art**: Aztec artists created intricate sculptures, masks, jewelry, and featherwork. They used materials such as stone, gold, jade, and colorful feathers from tropical birds.

3. **Writing and Record Keeping**: The Aztecs used a pictographic writing system to record history, tribute payments, religious calendars, and other information. They created books called codices made of bark paper or deerskin.

4. **Education**: The Aztecs valued education and had schools for both nobles and commoners. Noble children attended the calmecac, where they learned history, religion, law, astronomy, and writing. Commoner boys attended the telpochcalli, where they received military training and learned practical skills.

5. **Medicine**: Aztec physicians had extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and surgical techniques. They could set broken bones, treat wounds, and use herbal remedies for various ailments.

6. **Astronomy and Calendar**: The Aztecs studied astronomy and devised a complex calendar system. They used a 365-day solar calendar for agricultural purposes and a 260-day ritual calendar for religious observances.

## The Spanish Conquest

The Aztec Empire came to an abrupt end with the arrival of Spanish conquistadors led by Hernán Cortés in 1519.

### Cortés Arrives in Mexico

In February 1519, Hernán Cortés landed on the coast of Mexico with about 600 men, 16 horses, and several cannons. He had been sent by the governor of Cuba to explore the mainland, but Cortés had his own ambitions of conquest.

Cortés learned about the wealthy Aztec Empire from coastal peoples who resented Aztec rule. He also met La Malinche (also known as Doña Marina), a native woman who became his interpreter and advisor. With her help, Cortés formed alliances with the Aztecs' enemies, particularly the Tlaxcalans, who provided thousands of warriors to support the Spanish.

### The Fall of Tenochtitlán

In November 1519, Cortés and his men entered Tenochtitlán peacefully. The Aztec emperor, Moctezuma II, welcomed them, possibly believing that Cortés was the god Quetzalcoatl returning as prophesied. However, relations soon deteriorated. Cortés took Moctezuma hostage, and tensions escalated when the Spanish massacred Aztec nobles during a religious festival.

The Aztecs rebelled and drove the Spanish from the city in June 1520, during what became known as the Noche Triste (Sad Night). Many Spanish and Tlaxcalan allies were killed during the retreat. However, Cortés regrouped and laid siege to Tenochtitlán in May 1521.

The Spanish had several advantages:

1. **Superior Weapons**: The Spanish had steel swords, armor, crossbows, and firearms, which were more effective than Aztec obsidian-edged weapons.

2. **Horses**: The Aztecs had never seen horses before and were initially terrified of them. Spanish cavalry gave the conquistadors a significant tactical advantage.

3. **Native Allies**: Thousands of indigenous warriors, especially Tlaxcalans, fought alongside the Spanish against their Aztec oppressors.

4. **Disease**: A smallpox epidemic, brought by the Spanish, devastated the Aztec population, killing many defenders of Tenochtitlán, including the new emperor Cuitláhuac.

After a brutal three-month siege, Tenochtitlán fell to the Spanish and their allies on August 13, 1521. The last Aztec emperor, Cuauhtémoc, was captured and later executed. The Spanish destroyed much of the city and built their colonial capital, Mexico City, on its ruins.

### The Aftermath of Conquest

The fall of the Aztec Empire marked the beginning of Spanish colonial rule in Mexico. The Spanish imposed their language, religion, and political system on the indigenous population. They established an encomienda system, in which Spanish colonists were granted land and the right to demand tribute and labor from the native inhabitants.

The conquest had devastating consequences for the indigenous population. European diseases, to which the native peoples had no immunity, caused a demographic catastrophe. The population of central Mexico declined dramatically in the decades following the conquest. Many aspects of Aztec culture were suppressed or destroyed, including religious practices and written records.

However, elements of Aztec culture survived and blended with Spanish influences to create the mestizo culture of modern Mexico. The Nahuatl language, spoken by the Aztecs, is still spoken by over a million people in Mexico today. Aztec agricultural practices, foods, and artistic traditions continue to influence Mexican culture.

## Conclusion

The Aztecs built a powerful empire in central Mexico through military conquest and political alliances. Their capital, Tenochtitlán, was one of the world's largest and most impressive cities in the early 16th century. Aztec society was characterized by a strict social hierarchy, religious practices centered on human sacrifice, and significant achievements in architecture, art, education, and astronomy.

The Aztec Empire came to an end with the Spanish conquest led by Hernán Cortés in 1521. The conquest had profound and lasting effects on the indigenous population and led to the establishment of Spanish colonial rule in Mexico. Despite the destruction of their empire, aspects of Aztec culture have survived and continue to influence Mexican society today.

The rise and fall of the Aztec Empire represents a significant chapter in the history of the Americas, demonstrating both the remarkable achievements and the tragic vulnerabilities of pre-Columbian civilizations in the face of European expansion.
