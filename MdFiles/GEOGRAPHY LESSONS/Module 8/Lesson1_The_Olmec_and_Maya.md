## The Olmec

The region known as Mesoamerica stretches from the central part of Mexico south to include the northern part of Central America. It was in this region that a people called the Olmec (OHL-mek) developed the first complex civilization in Mesoamerica.

A civilization is an organized society within a specific area. Civilizations often include large cities in which different social classes of people live. Writing, formal education, art, and architecture are often features of civilizations. In civilizations, governments are made up of leaders or family groups. The governments make decisions that help the civilization develop. These characteristics improve people's quality of life.

Around 1200 BC, the Olmec settled in the lowlands along the Gulf of Mexico in what are today the southern Mexico states of Veracruz and Tabasco. This region's climate is hot and humid. Abundant rainfall and rich, fertile soil made this a perfect area for the Olmec to grow maize, or corn. Olmec also grew beans, squash, peppers, and avocados. In some places, the Olmec could harvest crops twice a year.

### Olmec Society and Culture

The Olmec built the first cities in Mesoamerica. The most important Olmec cities were San Lorenzo, La Venta, and Tres Zapotes. These cities were centers of religious and political power. Each city had a ruler who was both a political and religious leader. The rulers lived in large houses, while most people lived in small huts.

The Olmec are known for their massive stone sculptures. The most famous of these are colossal stone heads, some of which are more than 10 feet tall and weigh up to 20 tons. These heads may represent Olmec rulers. The Olmec also carved smaller objects from jade, a rare and valuable stone. These objects include figurines of both humans and animals.

Religion was an important part of Olmec life. The Olmec believed in many gods, including gods of rain, corn, and fire. They built large pyramid-shaped temples where they worshipped these gods. The Olmec also played a ritual ball game on stone courts. This game, which involved hitting a rubber ball through stone rings, had religious significance.

### Olmec Influence

The Olmec civilization began to decline around 400 BC, but their influence spread throughout Mesoamerica. Later civilizations, including the Maya, adopted many Olmec cultural practices. These included pyramid building, the ritual ball game, and the worship of similar gods.

The Olmec may have also developed the first writing system in Mesoamerica. Some Olmec artifacts contain symbols that may be early forms of writing. Later Mesoamerican civilizations, including the Maya, developed more complex writing systems.

## The Maya

The Maya civilization developed in parts of present-day Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador. The Maya were influenced by the Olmec, but they developed their own distinct culture.

### Geography and Early Maya

The Maya lived in three distinct geographical regions: the northern lowlands of the Yucatán Peninsula, the southern lowlands of central Guatemala and parts of Mexico, Belize, and western Honduras, and the southern highlands of southern Guatemala. Each region had its own climate and resources, which influenced how the Maya lived.

In the northern lowlands, the climate is hot and dry, with less rainfall than in the southern regions. The Maya in this region built wells and underground storage chambers called chultuns to collect and store rainwater. They grew crops such as maize, beans, and squash, but farming was more challenging in this region due to the drier conditions.

The southern lowlands have a hot, humid climate with abundant rainfall. This region includes tropical rainforests with rich biodiversity. The Maya in this region practiced slash-and-burn agriculture, clearing small plots of land by cutting and burning vegetation. They grew maize, beans, squash, and other crops. They also hunted animals such as deer and wild turkey and gathered fruits and nuts from the forest.

The southern highlands have a cooler climate due to their higher elevation. The Maya in this region grew crops such as maize, beans, and squash on terraced fields on the mountainsides. They also mined valuable resources such as jade and obsidian (volcanic glass), which were used for tools, weapons, and decorative objects.

### The Classic Age of Maya Civilization

The period from about 250 to 900 CE is known as the Classic period of Maya civilization. During this time, the Maya built great cities with impressive stone buildings, including temples, palaces, and ball courts. Some of the most important Maya cities included Tikal, Palenque, Copán, and Chichén Itzá.

Each Maya city was an independent city-state with its own ruler, known as an ajaw or "lord." These rulers claimed divine authority and were both political and religious leaders. They led their cities in warfare against other Maya cities and oversaw the construction of monumental architecture.

The Maya cities were connected by trade networks. They traded goods such as jade, obsidian, salt, cacao (chocolate), and textiles. Trade helped spread ideas and cultural practices throughout the Maya region.

### Maya Society and Culture

Maya society was highly stratified, with a clear hierarchy of social classes:

1. **Rulers and Nobles**: At the top of Maya society were the rulers and noble families. They controlled political power, owned the best land, and lived in the finest houses.

2. **Priests and Scribes**: Priests conducted religious ceremonies and made astronomical observations. Scribes recorded important events and kept administrative records. Both priests and scribes were highly educated and respected.

3. **Merchants and Artisans**: Merchants traded goods between Maya cities and with other Mesoamerican peoples. Artisans created pottery, textiles, jade carvings, and other crafts.

4. **Farmers and Laborers**: The majority of Maya people were farmers who grew crops such as maize, beans, and squash. They also provided labor for building projects and other communal work.

5. **Slaves**: At the bottom of Maya society were slaves, who were often prisoners of war or criminals. They performed the hardest and most dangerous work.

Religion was central to Maya life. The Maya believed in many gods associated with nature and celestial bodies. They believed that these gods needed to be appeased through offerings and sacrifices, including human sacrifice in some cases. The Maya built elaborate temples where priests performed religious ceremonies.

The Maya developed a complex writing system using hieroglyphs. They wrote on bark paper books called codices, as well as on pottery, stone monuments, and buildings. Maya writing included historical records, astronomical observations, and religious texts.

The Maya made remarkable achievements in mathematics and astronomy. They developed a vigesimal (base-20) number system that included the concept of zero. They created an accurate calendar system based on their astronomical observations. They built observatories to track the movements of the sun, moon, and stars, which they used for both religious and agricultural purposes.

Maya art and architecture were highly sophisticated. They built massive stone pyramids, temples, and palaces without the use of metal tools or the wheel. Their buildings were decorated with intricate carvings and colorful murals depicting gods, rulers, and important events. Maya artists also created fine pottery, jade carvings, and textiles.

### The Decline of Maya Civilization

Around 900 CE, many Maya cities in the southern lowlands were abandoned, and the population declined dramatically. This period is known as the Maya collapse. Several factors may have contributed to this decline:

1. **Environmental Problems**: Evidence suggests that the Maya may have faced environmental challenges such as deforestation, soil erosion, and drought. These problems could have reduced agricultural productivity and led to food shortages.

2. **Warfare**: Increased warfare between Maya city-states may have disrupted trade networks and agricultural production.

3. **Political Instability**: Competition between rival elites and challenges to the authority of rulers may have weakened Maya political systems.

4. **Disease**: Some researchers suggest that epidemics may have contributed to population decline.

It's important to note that the Maya civilization did not completely disappear. In the northern Yucatán Peninsula, cities like Chichén Itzá and later Mayapán continued to flourish for several centuries after the collapse in the southern lowlands. Additionally, Maya people and aspects of their culture have survived to the present day. Today, millions of people of Maya descent live in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador, and many continue to speak Maya languages and practice elements of traditional Maya culture.

## Maya Achievements

The Maya made significant contributions to art, architecture, mathematics, astronomy, and writing. Their achievements continue to impress and intrigue people today.

### Writing and Record Keeping

The Maya developed one of the most advanced writing systems in the ancient Americas. Their writing system used hieroglyphs—symbols that represent words, syllables, or sounds. Maya scribes wrote on bark paper books called codices, as well as on pottery, stone monuments, and buildings.

Maya writing included:

1. **Historical Records**: The Maya recorded important events such as the accession of rulers, military victories, and alliances between cities.

2. **Astronomical Observations**: They documented their observations of celestial bodies and used these to create accurate calendars.

3. **Religious Texts**: Many Maya texts deal with religious themes, including myths, rituals, and prophecies.

4. **Mathematical Calculations**: The Maya used their writing system to record mathematical calculations, including those used in their calendars.

Unfortunately, most Maya codices were destroyed by Spanish conquistadors and missionaries who considered them pagan and heretical. Only four Maya codices are known to have survived to the present day.

### Mathematics and Astronomy

The Maya developed a sophisticated mathematical system that included the concept of zero, which was a remarkable achievement for an ancient civilization. They used a vigesimal (base-20) number system, rather than the decimal (base-10) system used in most modern societies.

The Maya were skilled astronomers who carefully observed the movements of celestial bodies. They built observatories, such as the one at Chichén Itzá known as El Caracol, to track the movements of the sun, moon, Venus, and other celestial bodies.

Using their mathematical and astronomical knowledge, the Maya created several calendar systems:

1. **Tzolkin**: A 260-day sacred calendar used for religious purposes.

2. **Haab**: A 365-day solar calendar used for agricultural and civil purposes.

3. **Long Count**: A calendar used to track longer periods of time, which allowed the Maya to record dates far in the past and future.

The Maya calendar was remarkably accurate. Their calculation of the solar year was 365.2420 days, which is very close to the modern calculation of 365.2422 days.

### Art and Architecture

Maya art and architecture were highly sophisticated and reflected their religious beliefs and political systems.

Maya architecture included:

1. **Pyramids and Temples**: The Maya built massive stone pyramids with temples on top. These structures were used for religious ceremonies and to demonstrate the power of rulers.

2. **Palaces**: Maya rulers lived in elaborate palaces with multiple rooms, courtyards, and decorative elements.

3. **Ball Courts**: Every major Maya city had at least one ball court where the ritual ball game was played.

4. **Observatories**: Structures designed for astronomical observations, such as El Caracol at Chichén Itzá.

Maya buildings were constructed using the corbeled arch technique, in which stones are stacked with each layer extending slightly further inward than the one below it until they meet at the top. This technique allowed the Maya to create vaulted spaces without using true arches.

Maya art included:

1. **Stone Carvings**: The Maya carved intricate reliefs on stone monuments called stelae, which often depicted rulers and recorded important events.

2. **Murals**: Colorful murals decorated the walls of temples, palaces, and other buildings. These murals depicted gods, rulers, battles, and daily life.

3. **Pottery**: Maya potters created vessels with elaborate designs and hieroglyphic inscriptions.

4. **Jade Carvings**: The Maya considered jade more valuable than gold. They carved jade into jewelry, figurines, and masks, often for use in religious ceremonies or as burial offerings.

## Conclusion

The Olmec and Maya civilizations made significant contributions to the cultural and historical development of Mesoamerica. The Olmec, as the first complex civilization in the region, established cultural patterns that influenced later societies. The Maya built upon these foundations to create one of the most advanced civilizations of the ancient world, with remarkable achievements in writing, mathematics, astronomy, art, and architecture.

Although the Maya civilization experienced a significant decline in the southern lowlands around 900 CE, aspects of Maya culture continued in the northern Yucatán Peninsula and have survived to the present day. The legacy of these ancient civilizations continues to fascinate and inspire people around the world, and archaeological research continues to reveal new insights into their history and achievements.
