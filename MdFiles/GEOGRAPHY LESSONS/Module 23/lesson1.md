# Lesson 1: Human Beginnings in Africa

## The Big Idea
During the Stone Age, the early inhabitants of Africa learned to make tools and to adapt to their environments.

## Main Ideas
- The remains of early humans have been found at sites all around Africa.
- During the Stone and Iron Ages, Africans developed new technologies and lifestyles.

## If YOU lived there...
You live 200,000 years ago, in a time known as the Stone Age. A member of your group has offered to teach you his skill. You watch carefully as he strikes two black rocks together. A small piece flakes off. You try to copy him, but the rocks just break. Finally you learn to strike the rock just right. You have made a sharp stone knife!

**How will you use your new skill?**

## Early Human Sites

Scientists believe that the first humans evolved in Africa. The oldest hominid (human-like) fossils have been found in East Africa, particularly in the Great Rift Valley. This valley stretches from Ethiopia to Mozambique and contains many important archaeological sites.

### Olduvai Gorge
One of the most significant sites is Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. In 1959, archaeologists Mary and Louis Leakey discovered the skull of an early hominid that lived about 1.75 million years ago. They named this species Zinjanthropus boisei (now called Paranthropus boisei). Later, they found fossils of Homo habilis ("handy man"), who lived about 2 million years ago and made simple stone tools.

### Laetoli
Near Olduvai Gorge is another important site called Laetoli. Here, Mary Leakey discovered footprints of early hominids preserved in volcanic ash from about 3.6 million years ago. These footprints show that early hominids walked upright on two legs.

### Other Important Sites
- **Hadar, Ethiopia**: Home to the famous "Lucy" fossil (Australopithecus afarensis), who lived about 3.2 million years ago
- **Sterkfontein, South Africa**: Contains fossils of Australopithecus africanus dating back 2.5 million years
- **Koobi Fora, Kenya**: Rich in fossils from 1.5 to 2 million years ago

## The Evolution of Early Humans

Scientists have identified several stages in human evolution:

1. **Australopithecines** (4-2 million years ago): Early hominids that walked upright but had small brains
2. **Homo habilis** (2.4-1.5 million years ago): First species to make stone tools
3. **Homo erectus** (1.8 million-300,000 years ago): Spread from Africa to Asia and Europe, used fire
4. **Homo sapiens** (emerged about 300,000 years ago): Modern humans with larger brains and complex tool use

## The Stone Age in Africa

The Stone Age is divided into three periods:

### Paleolithic (Old Stone Age)
During this period (about 2.5 million to 12,000 years ago), early humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. They made simple stone tools by chipping stones to create sharp edges. These tools included:
- Hand axes
- Scrapers
- Spear points
- Knives

Early humans used these tools to:
- Hunt animals
- Dig for roots
- Cut meat
- Scrape hides for clothing

They also learned to control fire, which provided warmth, protection from predators, and a way to cook food.

### Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age)
As the climate warmed after the last Ice Age (around 12,000 years ago), humans developed more specialized tools:
- Smaller, more refined stone tools
- Bows and arrows
- Fishing equipment

### Neolithic (New Stone Age)
Beginning around 10,000 BCE in parts of Africa, people began to:
- Domesticate plants and animals
- Establish permanent settlements
- Create pottery
- Develop agriculture

## The Development of Agriculture

Agriculture developed independently in different parts of Africa:

### Nile Valley
By 5000 BCE, people along the Nile River were growing:
- Wheat and barley (originally from the Middle East)
- Local crops like sorghum

### West Africa
By 3000 BCE, farmers in the Sahel region were cultivating:
- Millet
- Sorghum
- Yams
- Rice

### Ethiopia
Farmers in the Ethiopian highlands domesticated:
- Teff (a grain)
- Ensete (false banana)
- Coffee

## The Iron Age in Africa

Around 1000 BCE, iron technology spread across Africa, revolutionizing agriculture and warfare:

### Iron Technology
- Iron tools were stronger and more durable than stone tools
- Iron weapons gave an advantage in warfare
- Iron-working required specialized knowledge and skills

### Nok Culture
One of the earliest iron-using cultures in sub-Saharan Africa was the Nok culture in what is now Nigeria (500 BCE to 200 CE). The Nok people:
- Created distinctive terracotta sculptures
- Used iron tools for farming
- Lived in organized settlements

### Bantu Migrations
The development of iron technology coincided with the Bantu migrations:
- Bantu-speaking peoples originated in the Nigeria-Cameroon region
- They gradually spread throughout central, eastern, and southern Africa
- They brought iron-working, agriculture, and their languages to new regions
- This migration took place over many centuries (1000 BCE to 1000 CE)

## Early African Societies

As agriculture and iron-working spread, different types of societies developed:

### Hunter-Gatherer Societies
Some groups, like the San people of southern Africa, continued their traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle:
- Moved seasonally to follow game and plant resources
- Lived in small, egalitarian groups
- Developed extensive knowledge of local plants and animals

### Pastoral Societies
In drier regions, people became pastoralists who herded animals:
- The Maasai and Turkana in East Africa herded cattle
- The Tuareg and Berber in North Africa herded camels and goats
- These societies were often nomadic or semi-nomadic

### Agricultural Societies
In regions with reliable rainfall or near rivers, agricultural societies developed:
- Built permanent settlements
- Developed specialized roles (farmers, craftspeople, traders)
- Created more complex social structures
- Eventually formed kingdoms and states

## Rock Art

Early Africans created rich artistic traditions, including rock art found throughout the continent:
- The Sahara Desert contains thousands of rock paintings dating from when the region was grassland (10,000-2,000 BCE)
- Southern Africa has numerous rock paintings by San hunter-gatherers
- These artworks depict daily life, religious ceremonies, and important animals

## Legacy of Early African Societies

The achievements of early Africans laid the foundation for later civilizations:
- Development of tools and technologies
- Domestication of unique African crops and animals
- Knowledge of local environments and resources
- Cultural and linguistic traditions
- Social and political organizations

These early innovations would eventually lead to the development of complex kingdoms and trading networks across the continent.

## Lesson 1 Assessment

1. **Key Terms**
   - Hominid
   - Paleolithic
   - Neolithic
   - Domestication
   - Bantu migrations

2. **Main Ideas**
   - How did early humans in Africa adapt to their environments?
   - What evidence do we have about early human evolution in Africa?
   - How did the development of agriculture change human societies in Africa?
   - What impact did iron technology have on African societies?

3. **Critical Thinking**
