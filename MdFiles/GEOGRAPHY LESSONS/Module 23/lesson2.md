# Lesson 2: Kingdoms in Africa

## The Big Idea
Between 300 and 1500, the people of Africa formed powerful kingdoms in several parts of the continent.

## Main Ideas
- Christianity became the major religion in Aksum and Ethiopia.
- Through its control of trade, Ghana built an empire.
- Mali and Songhai became powerful trading empires in West Africa.
- Great Zimbabwe controlled trade in East Africa.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a trader, traveling in a caravan from the north into West Africa in about 1000. The caravan carries many goods, but the most precious is salt. Salt is so valuable that people trade gold for it! You have never met the mysterious men who trade you the gold. You wish you could talk to them to find out where they get it.

**Why do you think the traders are so secretive?**

## Christian Kingdoms in Africa

As Stone Age people in Africa began to settle in communities, they developed more complex societies. Over time, these societies grew into kingdoms and empires. Some of the earliest kingdoms developed in Northeast Africa, in what is now Ethiopia and Eritrea.

### The Kingdom of Aksum

Around 100 CE, the kingdom of Aksum (also spelled Axum) emerged in the highlands of what is now Ethiopia and Eritrea. Aksum was strategically located near the Red Sea, allowing it to control trade routes between Africa and the Mediterranean world.

#### Trade and Economy
Aksum became a major trading power, connecting Africa with Arabia, India, and the Mediterranean. The kingdom exported:
- Ivory
- Gold
- Emeralds
- Slaves

And imported:
- Textiles
- Metal goods
- Wine
- Olive oil

#### Adoption of Christianity
In the 4th century CE, King Ezana of Aksum converted to Christianity. Under his rule, Aksum became one of the first kingdoms in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church developed its own unique traditions and remained isolated from other Christian communities for centuries.

#### Achievements
The Aksumites:
- Developed their own written script called Ge'ez, which is still used in Ethiopian religious texts
- Created a distinctive architectural style, including massive stone obelisks (stelae)
- Minted their own gold, silver, and bronze coins
- Built impressive stone churches, some carved directly into rock

#### Decline
By the 7th century, Aksum began to decline due to:
- The rise of Islam, which disrupted traditional trade routes
- Environmental degradation and soil exhaustion
- Conflicts with neighboring states

### The Ethiopian Empire

After Aksum's decline, a new Christian kingdom emerged in the Ethiopian highlands. This kingdom, known as the Ethiopian Empire or Abyssinia, would last for over a thousand years.

#### Religious Isolation
When Islam spread across North Africa and the Middle East, Ethiopia became isolated as a Christian "island" surrounded by Muslim states. This isolation helped Ethiopia develop a unique religious and cultural identity.

#### The Solomonic Dynasty
In 1270, a new dynasty came to power in Ethiopia, claiming descent from the biblical King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. This Solomonic Dynasty would rule Ethiopia until the 20th century.

#### Religious Architecture
The Ethiopian Christians created remarkable churches carved directly into solid rock. The most famous are the 11 monolithic churches at Lalibela, carved in the 12th-13th centuries. These churches were created by excavating deep trenches around large blocks of stone, then carving the churches from the inside out.

#### Cultural Achievements
Ethiopian culture flourished with:
- Illuminated religious manuscripts
- Distinctive religious music and dance
- A rich literary tradition in the Ge'ez language
- Unique artistic styles in painting and sculpture

## West African Kingdoms

While Christian kingdoms developed in East Africa, a series of powerful trading empires emerged in West Africa. These kingdoms controlled the valuable trans-Saharan trade routes connecting sub-Saharan Africa with North Africa and the Mediterranean.

### The Ghana Empire

The first major West African empire was Ghana (not to be confused with the modern country of Ghana, which is located to the south of the ancient empire). Ghana flourished from about 700 to 1200 CE in what is now southeastern Mauritania and western Mali.

#### Gold-Salt Trade
Ghana's power came from its control of the trans-Saharan trade, particularly the exchange of gold for salt:
- Gold came from regions to the south, in the forests of West Africa
- Salt came from mines in the Sahara Desert
- Ghana's rulers taxed all goods passing through their territory

#### The Silent Trade
The gold-salt trade often took place through a system called the "silent trade" or "dumb barter":
- Gold traders from the south and salt traders from the north would never meet directly
- Salt traders would leave their salt in a designated place
- Gold traders would leave what they considered a fair amount of gold
- Each side would take turns adjusting the amounts until both were satisfied
- This system protected the sources of both valuable commodities

#### Government and Society
Ghana was ruled by a king called the "Ghana" or "war chief," who:
- Controlled trade
- Collected taxes
- Commanded a large army
- Served as the supreme judge
- Performed religious ceremonies

The capital city, Koumbi Saleh, had two distinct sections:
- A Muslim quarter for North African merchants
- A royal district where traditional African religions were practiced

#### Decline
Ghana began to decline in the 11th century due to:
- Invasions by the Almoravids, a Berber Muslim dynasty
- Overgrazing, which led to environmental degradation
- The loss of control over trade routes
- Internal rebellions

### The Mali Empire

As Ghana declined, the Mali Empire rose to power in the 13th century under the leadership of Sundiata Keita. Mali expanded to become even larger than Ghana, controlling territory in what is now Mali, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, and parts of Mauritania and Niger.

#### Mansa Musa and the Hajj
Mali's most famous ruler was Mansa (Emperor) Musa I (ruled 1312-1337). In 1324, Mansa Musa made a legendary pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca:
- He traveled with a caravan of thousands of people
- He brought so much gold that he caused inflation in the cities he visited
- His generosity and wealth made Mali famous throughout the Islamic world
- He brought back scholars and architects who helped develop Mali's cities

#### Timbuktu: Center of Learning
Under Mali's rule, Timbuktu became a major center of Islamic learning:
- The city had numerous mosques and madrasas (Islamic schools)
- Scholars came from across the Islamic world to study and teach
- Libraries contained thousands of manuscripts on religion, science, mathematics, and literature
- Books were highly valued and a thriving industry of copyists and bookbinders developed

#### Islam in Mali
Mali's rulers converted to Islam, but most of the common people maintained their traditional beliefs or practiced a syncretic form of Islam that incorporated traditional elements. The empire's rulers:
- Built mosques in major cities
- Supported Islamic scholars
- Made pilgrimages to Mecca
- Established Islamic courts

#### Decline
Mali began to decline in the late 14th century due to:
- Succession disputes after Mansa Musa's death
- Rebellions in conquered territories
- Attacks from neighboring states
- The rise of the Songhai Empire

### The Songhai Empire

As Mali weakened, the Songhai people, centered around the city of Gao on the Niger River, began to assert their independence. Under the leadership of Sonni Ali (ruled 1464-1492), Songhai expanded to become the largest empire in West African history.

#### Sonni Ali's Conquests
Sonni Ali was a skilled military leader who:
- Captured Timbuktu in 1468
- Built a navy to control the Niger River
- Extended Songhai control over former Mali territories
- Balanced Islamic and traditional religious practices

#### Muhammad Ture and Islamic Reform
After Sonni Ali's death, Muhammad Ture (also known as Askia Muhammad) seized power. Unlike Sonni Ali, Muhammad Ture was a devout Muslim who:
- Strengthened Islamic institutions
- Appointed Islamic judges
- Supported scholars and built schools
- Made a pilgrimage to Mecca
- Divided the empire into provinces for better administration

#### Economy and Trade
The Songhai Empire controlled major trade routes and cities:
- Timbuktu remained a center of learning and trade
- Gao served as the capital and a major trading center
- Jenne was an important commercial city
- Trade goods included gold, salt, slaves, kola nuts, leather goods, and textiles

#### Decline
The Songhai Empire came to a sudden end in 1591 when it was defeated by a Moroccan army equipped with firearms. The Moroccans were interested in controlling the gold trade and the salt mines of Taghaza. After the Moroccan conquest:
- The empire fragmented into smaller states
- Trade routes were disrupted
- Many scholars fled Timbuktu
- The region entered a period of political instability

## East African Trading States

While West Africa developed empires based on trans-Saharan trade, East African coastal cities prospered through Indian Ocean trade networks.

### Swahili City-States

Between 1000 and 1500 CE, a string of trading cities developed along the East African coast from Somalia to Mozambique. These cities were part of the Swahili civilization, named after their language (Kiswahili, a Bantu language with Arabic influences).

#### Trade Networks
The Swahili cities were important links in Indian Ocean trade:
- Arab and Persian merchants brought textiles, porcelain, and spices
- Indian traders brought cotton, spices, and metal goods
- Chinese ships occasionally visited, bringing silk and porcelain
- East Africans exported gold, ivory, animal hides, slaves, and exotic woods

#### Culture and Society
Swahili culture was a blend of African and Arabian influences:
- Most people were Muslims
- Architecture combined African and Arabian styles
- The Swahili language used Arabic script
- Social hierarchies were based on wealth and ancestry

#### Major Cities
Important Swahili cities included:
- Kilwa (in modern Tanzania), known for its grand mosque and palace
- Mombasa (in modern Kenya), a major port city
- Sofala (in modern Mozambique), which controlled access to gold from the interior
- Lamu (in modern Kenya), known for its preserved Swahili architecture
- Zanzibar, which later became a major trading center and spice producer

### Great Zimbabwe

In the interior of southeastern Africa, a powerful state developed around a city now known as Great Zimbabwe. This state flourished between the 11th and 15th centuries in what is now Zimbabwe.

#### Architecture and Construction
Great Zimbabwe is famous for its impressive stone buildings:
- The Great Enclosure, a massive circular wall up to 36 feet high and 820 feet in circumference
- The Hill Complex, built on a granite hill
- Numerous smaller stone enclosures
- All built without mortar, using carefully fitted stones

#### Economy and Trade
Great Zimbabwe controlled trade routes between the gold-producing regions of the interior and the Swahili coast:
- Gold was the primary export
- Copper, ivory, and exotic animal products were also traded
- Imported goods included glass beads, porcelain, and cloth

#### Society and Culture
Great Zimbabwe was likely the capital of a kingdom ruled by the Shona people:
- The stone enclosures probably housed the elite
- The majority of people lived in traditional mud and thatch houses surrounding the stone structures
- Religious ceremonies were likely performed in the stone enclosures
- Artifacts found include soapstone bird carvings, which may have had religious significance

#### Decline
Great Zimbabwe began to decline in the 15th century due to:
- Environmental degradation from overgrazing and deforestation
- Exhaustion of nearby gold deposits
- Shifting trade routes
- Possibly political instability

After Great Zimbabwe's decline, smaller successor states emerged in the region.

## Other African Kingdoms

While Ghana, Mali, Songhai, and Great Zimbabwe were among the largest and most powerful African states, many other kingdoms and empires developed across the continent.

### The Kongo Kingdom

In Central Africa, the Kingdom of Kongo developed in the 14th century in what is now northern Angola and the western Democratic Republic of Congo. The kingdom:
- Was centrally organized with a king (Manikongo) and provincial governors
- Had a sophisticated tax system and currency
- Traded ivory, copper, and slaves
- Later established diplomatic relations with Portugal

### The Benin Kingdom

In what is now southern Nigeria, the Kingdom of Benin emerged in the 13th century and became known for:
- Sophisticated bronze and brass sculptures
- A well-organized government with a divine king (Oba)
- Impressive city walls and moats
- Control of trade routes to the interior

### The Hausa States

In northern Nigeria, a group of city-states known as the Hausa States developed from the 11th century onward. These states:
- Were major centers of trans-Saharan trade
- Adopted Islam as their religion
- Developed distinctive walled cities
- Were known for leather working, weaving, and dyeing

### The Kanem-Bornu Empire

Around Lake Chad, the Kanem-Bornu Empire flourished from the 9th to the 19th centuries:
- It controlled important trade routes across the Sahara
- Its rulers converted to Islam in the 11th century
- It maintained diplomatic relations with North African states
- It was known for its cavalry and military strength

## Legacy of African Kingdoms

The kingdoms and empires of medieval Africa left a lasting legacy:

### Political Organization
- Sophisticated systems of government
- Methods of administering large territories
- Diplomatic relations between states

### Economic Systems
- Control and taxation of trade routes
- Currency systems
- Specialized crafts and industries

### Cultural Achievements
- Architectural innovations
- Literary and scholarly traditions
- Religious institutions
- Artistic styles and techniques

### Religious Developments
- The establishment of Christianity in Ethiopia
- The spread of Islam across parts of Africa
- Syncretic religious practices combining Islam or Christianity with traditional beliefs

These kingdoms demonstrate that Africa had rich, complex civilizations with advanced political, economic, and cultural systems long before European colonization.
