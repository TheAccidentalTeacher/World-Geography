# Lesson 4: Imperialism and Independence

## The Big Idea
In the late 1800s, Europeans once again created colonies in Africa and became involved in African politics and economics.

## Main Ideas
- The search for raw materials led to a new wave of European involvement in Africa.
- European powers divided Africa into colonies with little regard for traditional ethnic or political boundaries.
- Africans resisted European control in various ways.
- After World War II, African nations gained their independence.

## If YOU lived there...
You are the chief of an African village in 1890. For many years, your people have been at war with a village in the next valley. One day, however, a warrior from that village delivers a message to you. His chief has been approached by soldiers with strange clothes and weapons. They say that both villages are now part of a colony that belongs to a place called England. The other chief wants to know how you will deal with these strangers.

**How will you respond to the other chief?**

## European Interest in Africa

After the abolition of the slave trade in the early 19th century, European interest in Africa initially declined. However, by the late 19th century, a new wave of European involvement in Africa began, driven by several factors.

### The Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution in Europe created new economic motivations for colonization:

#### Raw Materials
European factories needed raw materials that Africa could provide:
- **Rubber**: Essential for tires, hoses, and industrial belts
- **Palm oil**: Used as an industrial lubricant and in soap manufacturing
- **Cotton**: Needed for textile production
- **Minerals**: Copper, tin, gold, diamonds, and later uranium

#### Markets
Industrialization also created a need for new markets:
- European manufacturers sought places to sell their goods
- Colonial markets could be controlled to exclude competitors
- Growing populations in Europe needed more goods

### Strategic Interests

European powers also had strategic and political motivations:
- **Control of trade routes**: Especially after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869
- **Military bases**: To project power globally
- **Prestige**: Colonies were seen as symbols of national greatness
- **Competition**: Fear that rival powers would gain advantage

### Explorers and Missionaries

European knowledge of Africa's interior increased through the work of explorers and missionaries:

#### Major Explorers
- **Mungo Park**: Explored the Niger River in the 1790s and early 1800s
- **Richard Burton and John Speke**: Searched for the source of the Nile in the 1850s
- **David Livingstone**: Explored southern and central Africa from the 1840s to 1870s
- **Henry Morton Stanley**: Explored the Congo Basin in the 1870s

#### Missionary Activity
Christian missionaries established stations throughout Africa:
- They provided education and medical care
- They reported on African conditions to European audiences
- They often advocated for European intervention to end practices they disapproved of
- They sometimes served as cultural intermediaries between Africans and Europeans

### Social Darwinism and "Civilizing Mission"

European imperialism was justified by new ideologies:

#### Social Darwinism
This misapplication of Darwin's theories suggested that:
- Different races were at different stages of evolution
- Europeans were "more evolved" and thus had the right to rule "less evolved" peoples
- Competition between races was natural and inevitable

#### The "Civilizing Mission"
Europeans claimed a duty to "civilize" Africa by:
- Introducing European education
- Spreading Christianity
- Ending practices like slavery and human sacrifice
- Bringing "progress" and "modernity"

These ideas provided moral justification for conquest and exploitation.

## The Scramble for Africa

Between 1880 and 1914, European powers rapidly divided almost the entire African continent among themselves. This period is often called the "Scramble for Africa."

### The Berlin Conference

In 1884-1885, European powers met at the Berlin Conference to establish rules for claiming African territory:
- No African representatives were invited
- The conference established the principle of "effective occupation"
- Powers had to notify others of their claims
- They had to demonstrate actual control of claimed territories
- The Congo Basin was declared open to free trade

The conference did not actually divide Africa but set the rules for how it would be divided.

### Major Colonial Powers

Several European nations claimed large portions of Africa:

#### Great Britain
Britain followed a strategy of controlling a continuous line of territories from "Cape to Cairo":
- **Egypt** (1882): Controlled the Suez Canal
- **Sudan**: Conquered in the 1890s
- **East Africa**: Kenya and Uganda
- **Southern Africa**: South Africa, Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Nyasaland (Malawi)
- **West Africa**: Nigeria, Gold Coast (Ghana), Sierra Leone, Gambia

#### France
France established a vast empire across northern and western Africa:
- **Algeria**: Conquered beginning in 1830
- **Tunisia**: Made a protectorate in 1881
- **Morocco**: Established as a protectorate in 1912
- **West Africa**: Senegal, Mali, Niger, Ivory Coast, Guinea
- **Central Africa**: Chad, Gabon, Congo-Brazzaville
- **Madagascar**: Conquered in 1895

#### Germany
Germany, a late entrant to colonialism, claimed:
- **Southwest Africa** (Namibia)
- **East Africa** (Tanzania)
- **Cameroon**
- **Togoland**

#### Other Powers
- **Belgium**: King Leopold II personally claimed the Congo Free State, later transferred to the Belgian state
- **Italy**: Attempted to colonize Ethiopia (unsuccessfully) and gained Libya, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland
- **Portugal**: Maintained older colonies in Angola and Mozambique
- **Spain**: Held small territories in Morocco and Equatorial Guinea

### Methods of Conquest

European powers used various methods to establish control:

#### Military Conquest
- Superior weapons (machine guns, artillery) gave Europeans military advantage
- Small European forces could defeat much larger African armies
- Naval power allowed control of coastal regions

#### Treaties
- Europeans made treaties with African rulers
- These treaties were often misunderstood by African signatories
- Some treaties were fraudulent or signed under duress
- Treaties were used to claim large territories beyond what African rulers intended

#### Divide and Rule
- Europeans exploited existing conflicts between African groups
- They made alliances with some groups against others
- They created or reinforced ethnic divisions

#### Economic Pressure
- Control of trade routes forced cooperation
- Economic incentives were offered to compliant rulers
- Economic sanctions were used against resisters

## Colonial Rule in Africa

Once territories were claimed, European powers established various systems of colonial administration.

### Types of Colonial Rule

Colonial powers used different approaches to governing their African territories:

#### Direct Rule
France typically used direct rule:
- European officials directly administered territories
- Traditional African authorities were largely bypassed
- French laws and institutions were imposed
- The goal was cultural assimilation of Africans into French culture

#### Indirect Rule
Britain often employed indirect rule:
- Traditional African authorities were maintained but supervised by European officials
- Local customs and laws were respected to some extent
- British officials served as advisors to African rulers
- This approach was less expensive and required fewer European personnel

#### Settler Colonies
In some regions with favorable climates, large numbers of Europeans settled:
- **South Africa**: Dutch (Boer) and British settlers
- **Algeria**: French settlers
- **Kenya**: British settlers in the highlands
- **Rhodesia** (Zimbabwe): British settlers

In settler colonies, Europeans took the best land and created racially segregated societies.

### Economic Exploitation

Colonial economies were structured to benefit the European powers:

#### Export-Oriented Production
- Colonies were forced to produce raw materials for export
- Cash crops like cotton, cocoa, coffee, and rubber replaced food production
- Minerals were extracted with little processing in Africa
- Manufacturing was discouraged to prevent competition with European goods

#### Labor Systems
- **Forced Labor**: In some colonies, Africans were compelled to work on European projects
- **Taxation**: Taxes payable only in cash forced Africans to work for wages
- **Contract Labor**: Workers signed contracts that were often exploitative
- **Migrant Labor**: Men traveled long distances to work in mines or plantations

#### Infrastructure Development
- Railways and roads were built primarily to extract resources
- Ports were developed for export
- Little infrastructure served African needs
- Education and healthcare received minimal investment

### Social and Cultural Impact

Colonialism profoundly affected African societies:

#### Education
- Mission schools provided basic education
- Curriculum emphasized European culture and history
- Education was limited, focusing on creating clerks and low-level administrators
- Few Africans received higher education

#### Religion
- Christianity spread widely during the colonial period
- Islam continued to expand in some regions
- Traditional religions were often suppressed or marginalized
- Religious institutions sometimes provided spaces for African autonomy

#### Social Structures
- Traditional leadership roles were undermined
- New elites emerged based on education and employment in colonial systems
- Ethnic identities were sometimes reinforced or even created by colonial policies
- Gender roles changed as men were recruited for wage labor

#### Urbanization
- New cities grew around administrative centers and ports
- Rural-urban migration increased
- Urban areas became centers of cultural exchange and new identities

## African Resistance to Colonialism

Africans did not passively accept European domination. Resistance took many forms, from armed rebellion to cultural preservation.

### Armed Resistance

Many African societies fought against European invasion:

#### Major Resistance Movements
- **Ethiopia**: Under Emperor Menelik II, defeated Italy at the Battle of Adwa (1896)
- **Samori Touré**: Led resistance against French expansion in West Africa (1880s-1898)
- **Maji Maji Rebellion**: Against German rule in East Africa (1905-1907)
- **Herero and Nama**: Resisted German rule in Southwest Africa (1904-1908)
- **Zulu Kingdom**: Fought against British expansion in South Africa

Most armed resistance was eventually defeated due to European military superiority, but it often delayed or limited colonial control.

### Cultural and Religious Resistance

When military resistance failed, Africans found other ways to resist:

#### Religious Movements
- **Mahdist Movement**: Islamic resistance in Sudan
- **Mau Mau**: Combined traditional religion with anti-colonial resistance in Kenya
- **Independent Churches**: African Christians formed their own churches separate from European missions

#### Cultural Preservation
- Maintaining traditional practices secretly
- Adapting traditional customs to new circumstances
- Preserving oral histories and knowledge
- Using art, music, and dance as forms of expression and resistance

### Economic Resistance

Africans also resisted through economic means:
- **Tax Evasion**: Avoiding colonial taxes
- **Crop Choices**: Growing food rather than cash crops when possible
- **Labor Resistance**: Work slowdowns, strikes, and migration to avoid forced labor
- **Smuggling**: Maintaining traditional trade networks outside colonial control

### Political Organization

By the early 20th century, new forms of political resistance emerged:
- **Educated Elites**: Western-educated Africans began forming political associations
- **Pan-African Movement**: Intellectuals in Africa, Europe, and the Americas promoted African unity and rights
- **Labor Movements**: Workers organized to demand better conditions
- **Veterans**: Africans who fought in World War I returned with new political awareness

## The Road to Independence

World War II marked a turning point in African history. The war weakened European powers and strengthened independence movements.

### Impact of World War II

The war changed the colonial relationship in several ways:

#### Military Service
- Thousands of Africans fought for colonial powers
- They gained military experience and exposure to new ideas
- They questioned why they fought for freedom abroad but lacked it at home

#### Economic Changes
- Colonies increased production to support war efforts
- New industries developed in some African countries
- Labor shortages led to better wages and conditions for some workers

#### Ideological Shifts
- The Atlantic Charter (1941) promised self-determination for all peoples
- The United Nations Charter supported decolonization
- The Cold War led the US and USSR to support independence movements
- European public opinion began to turn against colonialism

### Independence Movements

After the war, independence movements gained strength across Africa:

#### North Africa
- **Egypt**: Gained full independence in 1952 after a military coup
- **Libya**: Became independent in 1951
- **Morocco and Tunisia**: Gained independence from France in 1956
- **Algeria**: Won independence after a bloody war (1954-1962)

#### Sub-Saharan Africa
- **Ghana**: Led by Kwame Nkrumah, became the first sub-Saharan colony to gain independence in 1957
- **1960**: The "Year of Africa" saw 17 countries gain independence
- By 1970, most African countries had achieved formal independence

#### Southern Africa
- **Angola and Mozambique**: Gained independence from Portugal in 1975 after armed struggles
- **Zimbabwe**: Achieved majority rule in 1980 after a guerrilla war
- **Namibia**: Became independent from South Africa in 1990
- **South Africa**: Ended apartheid and established majority rule in 1994

### Leaders of Independence

Several key figures led the independence movements:

#### West Africa
- **Kwame Nkrumah** (Ghana): Advocated Pan-Africanism and immediate independence
- **Léopold Sédar Senghor** (Senegal): Poet and philosopher who developed the concept of Négritude
- **Sékou Touré** (Guinea): Led Guinea to immediate independence rather than accepting limited autonomy

#### East Africa
- **Jomo Kenyatta** (Kenya): Led the Kenya African National Union
- **Julius Nyerere** (Tanzania): Developed African socialism (Ujamaa)
- **Milton Obote** and **Idi Amin** (Uganda): Led Uganda to independence and subsequent dictatorship

#### Central and Southern Africa
- **Patrice Lumumba** (Congo): Briefly led the independent Congo before his assassination
- **Nelson Mandela** (South Africa): Led the struggle against apartheid
- **Robert Mugabe** (Zimbabwe): Led the liberation struggle and later became a controversial authoritarian leader

### Challenges of Independence

Newly independent African nations faced numerous challenges:

#### Political Challenges
- Creating national unity in countries with artificial colonial boundaries
- Building democratic institutions without democratic traditions
- Balancing traditional authorities with modern state structures
- Dealing with military coups and political instability

#### Economic Challenges
- Economies still oriented toward export of raw materials
- Continued economic dependence on former colonial powers
- Lack of industrial development
- Unequal distribution of resources

#### Social Challenges
- Providing education and healthcare with limited resources
- Rapid urbanization and population growth
- Ethnic tensions sometimes exacerbated by colonial policies
- Balancing traditional and modern social structures

## Africa in the Global Context

Since independence, African nations have sought to define their place in the world.

### Pan-Africanism

The idea of African unity has been an important theme:
- The Organization of African Unity (OAU) was founded in 1963
- It was replaced by the African Union (AU) in 2002
- Regional organizations like ECOWAS (West Africa) and SADC (Southern Africa) promote cooperation
- Cultural and intellectual movements emphasize shared African heritage

### Cold War Influences

During the Cold War (1945-1991):
- Some African countries aligned with the Soviet bloc
- Others maintained ties with Western powers
- Non-aligned movement offered a third option
- Superpowers provided aid but also interfered in African politics

### Economic Development

African countries have pursued various development strategies:
- State-led development in the 1960s and 1970s
- Structural adjustment programs in the 1980s and 1990s
- Regional economic integration
- Diversification beyond raw material exports

### Contemporary Issues

Today, African nations face both challenges and opportunities:
- Rapid economic growth in some countries
- Technological innovation, especially in mobile technology
- Democratic consolidation in many nations
- Ongoing conflicts and governance challenges in others
- Climate change impacts
- Growing youth population

## Legacy of Colonialism

The colonial period, though relatively brief (about 70-80 years for most of Africa), left a profound legacy:

### Political Legacy
- National boundaries that often ignore ethnic and cultural realities
- Centralized state structures modeled on European systems
- Legal systems based on European models
- Languages of former colonizers often used in government and education

### Economic Legacy
- Continued economic relationships with former colonial powers
- Economic structures focused on raw material exports
- Uneven development within countries
- Limited industrial development

### Social and Cultural Legacy
- Educational systems based on European models
- Religious changes (spread of Christianity and Islam)
- Urban centers developed during colonial period
- Cultural hybridity combining African and European elements

Despite these colonial legacies, African nations have worked to forge their own paths, reclaim their histories, and develop solutions to their unique challenges.
