# Lesson 3: Africa in Global Trade

## The Big Idea
Africa's wealth and mineral resources attracted the attention of traders from other parts of the world, whose actions eventually led to the enslavement of millions of Africans.

## Main Ideas
- Trade led to the spread of Islam in East Africa.
- Europeans established trading posts along Africa's coasts.
- The slave trade devastated many African societies.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a sailor on a trading ship from Arabia in search of new products to sell back home. After several days at sea, your captain decides to land along the African coast. As you reach the shore, you are greeted by a group of villagers wearing gold and ivory jewelry.

**What does this suggest about Africa's resources?**

## Trade in East Africa

For centuries, Africa had been involved in trade networks that connected it with other parts of the world. The east coast of Africa, in particular, had strong trading connections with Arabia, Persia, India, and even China.

### The Swahili Coast

The Swahili Coast stretched along East Africa from present-day Somalia to Mozambique. By the 8th century CE, Arab and Persian traders had established trading settlements along this coast. These settlements gradually grew into prosperous city-states.

#### Major Trading Cities
- **Mogadishu** (in modern Somalia): One of the northernmost Swahili cities
- **Lamu** and **Mombasa** (in modern Kenya): Important trading ports
- **Zanzibar** and **Kilwa** (in modern Tanzania): Major commercial centers
- **Sofala** (in modern Mozambique): Connected to gold mines in the interior

#### Trade Goods
The Swahili city-states exported:
- Gold from the interior (especially from Great Zimbabwe)
- Ivory from elephant tusks
- Animal hides and exotic animal products
- Slaves
- Timber and mangrove poles
- Ambergris (used in perfumes)

They imported:
- Textiles from India and Arabia
- Porcelain and silk from China
- Glass beads and glassware
- Metal goods
- Spices

### The Spread of Islam

Trade brought not only goods but also ideas and religion to East Africa. Arab and Persian traders brought Islam to the Swahili Coast.

#### Conversion to Islam
- By the 10th century, most Swahili cities had converted to Islam
- Ruling families were the first to convert, seeing political and economic advantages
- Mosques became central features of Swahili cities
- Arabic script was adopted for writing the Swahili language

#### Islamic Influence on Architecture
Islamic influence can be seen in Swahili architecture:
- Mosques with distinctive minarets
- Homes of wealthy merchants with inner courtyards
- Decorative elements like arches and carved doors
- Prayer niches (mihrab) indicating the direction of Mecca

#### Cultural Synthesis
Swahili culture became a blend of African and Islamic elements:
- Islamic religious practices combined with local traditions
- Arabic loan words entered the Swahili language
- Islamic scholarship flourished alongside local knowledge
- Marriage alliances between Arab traders and local families created new social groups

## European Arrival in Africa

While East Africa had long-established trade connections across the Indian Ocean, European contact with sub-Saharan Africa was limited until the 15th century. This changed when Portuguese explorers began sailing down the African coast.

### Portuguese Exploration

In the early 15th century, Portugal began a systematic effort to explore the African coast, motivated by:
- The search for a sea route to Asia to bypass Muslim-controlled land routes
- Interest in finding the source of West African gold
- The desire to contact the legendary Christian kingdom of Prester John (believed to be in Ethiopia)
- The spread of Christianity
- Commercial opportunities

#### Key Portuguese Explorations
- **1415**: Portugal captured Ceuta in North Africa
- **1434**: Gil Eanes rounded Cape Bojador on the West African coast
- **1441**: Portuguese ships returned with the first enslaved Africans
- **1482**: Diogo CÃ£o reached the mouth of the Congo River
- **1488**: Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope
- **1497-1499**: Vasco da Gama sailed around Africa to India

### Trading Posts and Forts

As Portuguese ships explored the African coast, they established trading posts and forts:
- **Elmina Castle** (1482) on the Gold Coast (modern Ghana) was built to protect Portuguese gold trade
- **Mozambique Island** became a major Portuguese base on the East African coast
- **Luanda** (in modern Angola) was established in 1575
- **Sofala** was captured to gain access to the gold trade

These trading posts served multiple purposes:
- Secure bases for ships to resupply
- Centers for trade with local populations
- Military strongholds to protect Portuguese interests
- Missionary centers for spreading Christianity

### Other European Powers

Portugal's success inspired other European nations to establish their own trading posts in Africa:
- **England** established forts on the Gold Coast in the 17th century
- **France** built trading posts in Senegal and along the West African coast
- **Netherlands** captured some Portuguese forts and established new ones
- **Denmark** and **Sweden** also established smaller trading operations

These European powers competed for control of strategic locations and trade routes, often forming alliances with local African rulers.

## The Triangular Trade

By the 16th century, a new pattern of trade emerged connecting Europe, Africa, and the Americas. This "triangular trade" would have devastating consequences for Africa.

### The Trade Pattern

The triangular trade worked as follows:
1. **Europe to Africa**: European ships carried manufactured goods (textiles, metal goods, guns, alcohol) to Africa
2. **Africa to Americas**: Ships loaded with enslaved Africans crossed the Atlantic to the Americas (the "Middle Passage")
3. **Americas to Europe**: Ships returned to Europe carrying plantation products (sugar, tobacco, cotton, rum)

This trade pattern maximized profits by keeping ships full on each leg of the journey.

### European Goods in Africa

Europeans traded various goods to obtain enslaved people:
- **Textiles**: Cotton cloth, silk, linen
- **Weapons**: Guns, gunpowder, swords
- **Metal goods**: Brass and copper items, iron bars
- **Alcohol**: Rum, brandy
- **Decorative items**: Glass beads, mirrors

These goods were traded to African merchants and rulers who supplied captives for enslavement.

## The Atlantic Slave Trade

The Atlantic slave trade was one of the largest forced migrations in human history. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, approximately 12.5 million Africans were shipped to the Americas, with about 10.7 million surviving the journey.

### Origins of the Trade

Slavery existed in many societies throughout history, including in Africa. However, the Atlantic slave trade was unprecedented in its scale and organization:
- Initially, Portuguese traders purchased small numbers of enslaved people along the West African coast
- After Europeans colonized the Americas, demand for labor increased dramatically
- The development of plantation agriculture (especially sugar) created an enormous demand for workers
- Indigenous American populations had been devastated by disease, creating labor shortages

### Sources of Enslaved People

Enslaved Africans came from various regions:
- **Senegambia** (modern Senegal and Gambia)
- **Gold Coast** (modern Ghana)
- **Bight of Benin** (modern Togo, Benin, and western Nigeria)
- **Bight of Biafra** (eastern Nigeria and Cameroon)
- **West-Central Africa** (Congo and Angola)
- **Southeast Africa** (Mozambique and Madagascar)

Different regions dominated the trade at different times, with West-Central Africa providing the largest number overall.

### Methods of Enslavement

Africans became enslaved through various means:
- **Warfare**: Captives taken in wars between African states
- **Raids**: Attacks on villages specifically to capture people
- **Judicial enslavement**: Criminals condemned to slavery as punishment
- **Debt slavery**: People enslaved to pay off debts
- **Kidnapping**: Individuals seized by small-scale raiders

European demand for enslaved people intensified warfare and raiding between African states and encouraged the expansion of states that specialized in slave trading.

### The Middle Passage

The journey across the Atlantic, known as the Middle Passage, was horrific:
- Captives were packed into ships with minimal space (often less than 6 feet by 1.5 feet per person)
- They were chained together to prevent resistance or suicide
- Disease spread rapidly in the unsanitary conditions
- Food and water were often inadequate
- Mortality rates averaged 15-20%, but could be much higher
- The journey typically took 6-8 weeks

Upon arrival in the Americas, survivors were sold at auction and distributed to plantations, mines, or urban households.

### Resistance to Slavery

Africans resisted enslavement at every stage:
- **In Africa**: Fighting against raids and refusing to cooperate with slave traders
- **During the Middle Passage**: Rebellions on ships, hunger strikes, and suicide
- **In the Americas**: Escaping, forming maroon communities, rebellions, and everyday forms of resistance

Notable slave rebellions included:
- The 1739 Stono Rebellion in South Carolina
- The 1791 Haitian Revolution, which led to Haiti's independence
- The 1831 Nat Turner's Rebellion in Virginia

### Impact on Africa

The slave trade had devastating effects on African societies:
- **Demographic impact**: Loss of millions of people, primarily young men and women
- **Political disruption**: Intensified warfare and the rise of militaristic states
- **Economic distortion**: Shift from productive activities to slave raiding
- **Social damage**: Breakdown of communities and family structures
- **Psychological trauma**: Fear and insecurity in affected regions

Some African kingdoms, like Dahomey and Asante, grew powerful through their involvement in the slave trade, while others were severely weakened or destroyed.

## The End of the Slave Trade

By the late 18th century, opposition to the slave trade began to grow in Europe and America.

### Abolitionist Movement

Several factors contributed to the rise of abolitionism:
- **Religious objections**: Quakers and evangelical Christians argued that slavery was sinful
- **Enlightenment ideals**: Philosophers promoted concepts of human rights and equality
- **Economic arguments**: Some economists argued that free labor was more productive than slave labor
- **Slave resistance**: Rebellions made slavery increasingly costly and dangerous
- **Former enslaved people**: Individuals like Olaudah Equiano published accounts of their experiences

### Legal Abolition

Gradually, nations began to outlaw the slave trade:
- **1807**: Britain and the United States prohibited the importation of slaves
- **1808**: United States ban on slave imports took effect
- **1814-1815**: The Congress of Vienna condemned the slave trade
- **1833**: Britain abolished slavery throughout its empire
- **1848**: France abolished slavery in its colonies
- **1865**: The United States abolished slavery with the 13th Amendment
- **1888**: Brazil became the last Western nation to abolish slavery

Despite legal abolition, the British Navy had to patrol the African coast for decades to suppress illegal slave trading.

### New Forms of Exploitation

Even as the Atlantic slave trade declined, new forms of exploitation emerged:
- **"Legitimate trade"**: European merchants shifted to trading in palm oil, peanuts, timber, and other commodities
- **Colonial labor systems**: Forced labor, taxation, and coercive labor recruitment replaced slavery
- **Domestic slavery**: Continued within Africa until gradually abolished by colonial powers

## Legacy of the Slave Trade

The Atlantic slave trade left a profound and lasting impact:

### In Africa
- Demographic losses that affected development for generations
- Political fragmentation that made resistance to European colonization more difficult
- Economic distortions that persisted into the colonial era
- Cultural and social disruptions with long-term consequences

### In the Americas
- Creation of large African diaspora populations
- Development of distinctive African-American cultures
- Racial ideologies created to justify slavery
- Economic systems built on exploitation

### Globally
- Wealth accumulation in Europe and North America partially built on slave labor
- Development of racial theories and racism
- Long-term economic inequalities between regions
- Cultural connections across the Atlantic world

The consequences of this massive forced migration continue to shape societies around the Atlantic basin today.
