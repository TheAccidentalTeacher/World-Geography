## Boundaries and Borders

There are about 200 countries in the world today. Each country has political boundaries, or borders. Within a country there are also many smaller political units, such as cities, counties, and states, each with its own set of borders. There are two main types of borders used to set political boundariesâ€”physical borders and human borders.

### Physical Borders

Borders sometimes follow natural boundaries. Mountains, deserts, and oceans make good natural boundaries because they are often difficult to cross and are permanent markers. For example, the Andes Mountains form the eastern border of Chile, while the Pacific Ocean forms Chile's western border. These two physical features give Chile a long, skinny shape.

Rivers and lakes are other natural boundaries used to set borders. For example, the Chattahoochee River forms part of the border between Alabama and Georgia. The Great Lakes form part of the border between the United States and Canada.

### Human Borders

Not all borders follow natural boundaries. Some borders are human borders, or borders created by people. These borders may be based on cultural differences, such as language or religion. For example, the border between Belgium and the Netherlands separates areas where people speak different languages.

Other human borders are based on historical events, such as wars or treaties. For example, the 38th parallel, which divides North and South Korea, was established after the Korean War ended in 1953. This border, known as the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), is heavily guarded by soldiers from both countries.

Some human borders are simply straight lines drawn on a map. For example, the border between the United States and Canada west of the Great Lakes follows the 49th parallel, an imaginary line of latitude that circles the Earth.

## Sovereign Nations

Countries with internationally recognized borders are called sovereign nations. A sovereign nation is an independent country with the authority to govern itself. Sovereign nations have the power to make their own laws, control their own military, and conduct their own foreign policy.

The United States is a sovereign nation. It has its own government, military, and foreign policy. The United States conducts trade with other countries, signs treaties, and participates in international organizations like the United Nations.

Not all territories are sovereign nations. Some territories are controlled by other countries. For example, Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. While Puerto Rico has its own local government, it is not a sovereign nation. The United States controls Puerto Rico's foreign policy and military.

## International Relations

Sovereign nations interact with each other in many ways. They trade goods and services, form alliances, and work together to address global issues. These interactions are part of international relations.

### Foreign Policy

Each sovereign nation has its own foreign policy, or plan for dealing with other countries. A nation's foreign policy is based on its national interests, or what it believes is best for its citizens. National interests include security, economic prosperity, and the promotion of values like democracy and human rights.

Nations use various tools to conduct foreign policy, including:

1. **Diplomacy**: Diplomacy is the practice of conducting negotiations between nations. Diplomats represent their countries in discussions with other nations. They work to resolve conflicts, negotiate treaties, and build relationships with other countries.

2. **Economic Tools**: Nations use economic tools like trade agreements, tariffs, and sanctions to advance their interests. For example, a nation might offer favorable trade terms to a friendly country or impose economic sanctions on a country that violates international norms.

3. **Military Power**: Nations maintain military forces to protect their security and advance their interests. Military power can be used to deter aggression, respond to attacks, or intervene in conflicts.

### International Trade

Trade between nations is an important part of international relations. Countries trade goods and services to obtain resources they need and to sell products they produce. International trade benefits countries by:

1. **Providing Access to Resources**: Countries can obtain resources that are not available within their borders. For example, Japan imports oil because it has few natural oil reserves.

2. **Expanding Markets**: Countries can sell their products to consumers in other countries, increasing their economic growth. For example, the United States exports agricultural products to countries around the world.

3. **Lowering Prices**: International trade allows countries to specialize in producing goods they can make efficiently, lowering prices for consumers. For example, many electronic products are manufactured in countries with lower labor costs.

## The World Community

The nations of the world form a global community that works together to address common challenges. This world community includes international organizations, treaties, and agreements that help nations cooperate.

### The United Nations

The United Nations (UN) is an international organization founded in 1945 after World War II. Its mission is to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, and promote social progress and human rights.

The UN has several main bodies:

1. **General Assembly**: All UN member states have a seat in the General Assembly, which discusses global issues and makes recommendations.

2. **Security Council**: The Security Council is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. It has 15 members, including five permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) that have veto power.

3. **Secretariat**: The Secretariat carries out the day-to-day work of the UN, led by the Secretary-General.

4. **International Court of Justice**: This is the UN's judicial body, which settles legal disputes between nations.

The UN also includes specialized agencies that address specific global issues, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

### Human Rights

Human rights are basic rights and freedoms that all people are entitled to, regardless of nationality, race, religion, gender, or other status. These rights include the right to life, liberty, and security of person; freedom from slavery and torture; freedom of opinion and expression; and the right to education and work.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, outlines these rights. Many international treaties and agreements are based on this declaration.

Despite widespread agreement on the importance of human rights, violations occur in many parts of the world. These violations include torture, arbitrary detention, discrimination, and restrictions on freedom of speech and religion.

### Humanitarian Aid

When disasters strike or conflicts arise, the world community often responds with humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid is assistance provided to people in need, such as victims of natural disasters, refugees, and people affected by war.

Humanitarian aid can include:

1. **Food and Water**: Providing basic necessities to people who lack access to them.

2. **Medical Care**: Treating injuries and illnesses and preventing the spread of disease.

3. **Shelter**: Providing temporary housing for people who have lost their homes.

4. **Education**: Ensuring that children can continue their education during crises.

Many organizations provide humanitarian aid, including UN agencies, government agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and non-governmental organizations like the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders.

## Global Challenges

The world community faces many global challenges that require international cooperation to address. These challenges include:

### Climate Change

Climate change is a global challenge that affects all nations. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events threaten agriculture, infrastructure, and human health. Addressing climate change requires international cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to changing conditions.

### Terrorism

Terrorism is the use of violence to achieve political goals. Terrorist groups operate across national borders, making international cooperation essential to combating them. Nations work together to share intelligence, disrupt terrorist financing, and prevent attacks.

### Poverty and Inequality

Despite global economic growth, many people around the world still live in poverty. Addressing poverty and inequality requires international cooperation to promote economic development, provide education and healthcare, and ensure that the benefits of growth are shared widely.

### Disease

Infectious diseases can spread quickly across borders, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Preventing and responding to disease outbreaks requires international cooperation in surveillance, research, and healthcare delivery.

## Conclusion

The world is divided into many different nations, each with its own borders, government, and interests. These nations interact through trade, diplomacy, and international organizations to advance their interests and address common challenges. By working together as a world community, nations can resolve conflicts, protect human rights, and address global issues that affect all people.
