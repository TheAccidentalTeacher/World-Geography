## Duties and Roles of Citizenship

The United States has a democratic, representative government. In such a system, people are the ultimate source of government authority. Elections are free and fair. Elected representatives closely follow the wishes of the people. Citizens typically enjoy rights and privileges such as freedom of speech and freedom of religion. For a representative government to work well, citizens must participate actively and perform certain duties. Let's look at some duties of U.S. citizens.

### Obeying the Law

Of course, all Americans must obey the law. Otherwise, our society would collapse. To obey laws, you must know what they are. For example, if you are stopped for speeding, it will not help to claim that you did not know the speed limit. It is your duty to find out what the speed limit is and to obey it.

### Attending School

You have to go to school, at least until age 16. A democracy cannot function without educated citizens. That is why we have free public schools. People need good reading and thinking skills so they can wisely choose their leaders and understand issues that affect them. Education also provides workforce skills so people can get jobs and help the economy grow.

### Paying Taxes

All citizens must pay taxes. Taxes fund government services such as schools, roads, police, and fire protection. The federal government collects income taxes to pay for national defense, Social Security, Medicare, and other programs. State and local governments collect various taxes to pay for education, transportation, public safety, and other services.

### Serving in the Military

In times of national emergency, the government may institute a draft, requiring eligible citizens (typically young men) to serve in the military. The United States has not had a draft since the Vietnam War ended in the 1970s. Today, military service is voluntary. However, all men must register with the Selective Service System when they turn 18, in case a draft becomes necessary in the future.

### Serving on a Jury

Another duty of citizenship is jury duty. When called, citizens must serve on juries in court cases. Jury duty ensures that people accused of crimes receive fair trials by a jury of their peers. It also allows citizens to participate directly in the justice system.

## Responsible Citizenship

Beyond these basic duties, good citizens accept additional responsibilities to maintain a strong democracy. These responsibilities are not legally required but are essential for a healthy democratic society.

### Staying Informed

Good citizens stay informed about current events and issues affecting their community, nation, and world. They read newspapers, watch news programs, and seek information from reliable sources. Being informed helps citizens make educated decisions when voting and participating in civic life.

### Voting

Voting is one of the most important responsibilities of citizenship in a democracy. By voting, citizens choose their representatives and have a say in government policies. Unfortunately, many eligible voters do not exercise this right. In presidential elections, typically only about 60 percent of eligible voters cast ballots. In local elections, turnout is often much lower.

To vote in the United States, citizens must:
1. Be at least 18 years old
2. Register to vote in their state
3. Meet their state's residency requirements
4. Not be disqualified due to certain criminal convictions (varies by state)

### Participating in the Community

Good citizens participate in their communities in various ways:

1. **Volunteering**: Citizens can volunteer with schools, hospitals, religious organizations, and community groups to help others and improve their communities.

2. **Attending Public Meetings**: Citizens can attend city council meetings, school board meetings, and other public forums to stay informed and voice their opinions on local issues.

3. **Supporting Community Projects**: Citizens can support community improvement projects, such as park cleanups, food drives, and neighborhood watch programs.

4. **Running for Office**: Some citizens choose to run for public office at the local, state, or national level to serve their communities directly.

### Respecting the Rights of Others

In a diverse society like the United States, citizens must respect the rights and opinions of others, even when they disagree. This includes respecting freedom of speech, religion, and assembly for all people. Civil discourse—discussing issues respectfully and thoughtfully—is essential for a functioning democracy.

## Influencing Government

Citizens in a democracy have many ways to influence their government beyond voting. These methods allow citizens to make their voices heard and shape government policies.

### Political Parties

Political parties are organizations that seek to influence government by nominating and supporting candidates for public office. In the United States, the two major political parties are the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. There are also several smaller parties, such as the Libertarian Party and the Green Party.

Citizens can join political parties, volunteer for campaigns, donate money to candidates, and participate in party activities. Political parties help citizens organize around shared values and policy preferences.

### Interest Groups

Interest groups are organizations that seek to influence government policies on specific issues. Unlike political parties, interest groups do not nominate candidates for office. Instead, they focus on advocating for particular policies or causes.

Examples of interest groups include:
1. **Business groups**: The Chamber of Commerce, industry associations
2. **Labor unions**: AFL-CIO, teachers' unions
3. **Environmental groups**: Sierra Club, Nature Conservancy
4. **Civil rights groups**: NAACP, American Civil Liberties Union
5. **Professional associations**: American Medical Association, American Bar Association

Citizens can join interest groups that align with their concerns and values. Interest groups advocate for their members through lobbying, public education campaigns, and legal action.

### Contacting Elected Officials

Citizens can directly contact their elected representatives to express their views on issues. They can:
1. Write letters or emails
2. Make phone calls
3. Attend town hall meetings
4. Visit representatives' offices
5. Participate in public hearings

Elected officials often consider constituent input when making decisions, especially when they receive many messages on the same issue.

### Public Opinion

Public opinion refers to the attitudes and beliefs that people have about political issues. In a democracy, public opinion can significantly influence government policies and actions. Politicians often consider public opinion when making decisions, especially on controversial issues.

Public opinion is measured through:
1. **Polls and Surveys**: Organizations conduct scientific polls to gauge public attitudes on various issues.
2. **Focus Groups**: Small groups of people discuss issues in depth, providing qualitative insights into public opinion.
3. **Media Coverage**: News media report on public reactions to events and policies.
4. **Social Media**: Online platforms allow citizens to express their views and organize around issues.

### Protests and Demonstrations

Citizens have the right to peacefully assemble and protest government actions or policies they oppose. Throughout American history, protests have played an important role in bringing about social and political change. Examples include the civil rights movement, anti-war protests, and women's suffrage marches.

Effective protests:
1. Have clear goals and messages
2. Are peaceful and nonviolent
3. Attract media attention and public support
4. Are part of broader advocacy strategies

## Citizenship in Other Societies

The roles and responsibilities of citizens vary depending on the type of government in their society. Let's explore citizenship in different types of societies.

### Democratic Societies

In democratic societies like the United States, Canada, and many European countries, citizens have extensive rights and responsibilities. They can:
1. Vote in free and fair elections
2. Express their opinions freely
3. Join political parties and interest groups
4. Run for public office
5. Criticize the government without fear of punishment

Citizens in democracies are expected to participate actively in civic life, stay informed about issues, and hold their government accountable.

### Authoritarian Societies

In authoritarian societies, citizens have limited political rights. They may not be able to:
1. Vote in meaningful elections
2. Express opinions freely, especially criticism of the government
3. Form independent political parties or interest groups
4. Access uncensored information

In these societies, the government expects citizens to be obedient and loyal. Political participation is often limited to government-approved activities, such as voting in elections with predetermined outcomes or joining government-sponsored organizations.

### Totalitarian Societies

In totalitarian societies, the government controls nearly all aspects of citizens' lives. Citizens have few, if any, political rights. The government expects complete loyalty and may require citizens to:
1. Participate in government-sponsored political activities
2. Express support for the regime
3. Report "disloyal" behavior by others
4. Conform to official ideology

In these societies, citizenship is defined primarily by obligations to the state rather than by rights and freedoms.

### Transitional Societies

Some societies are transitioning from authoritarian or totalitarian systems to more democratic forms of government. In these transitional societies, citizenship roles are evolving. Citizens may be gaining new rights and responsibilities but still face restrictions on their political participation.

For example, after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s, citizens in countries like Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic gradually gained democratic rights and responsibilities. However, building a culture of active citizenship took time after decades of authoritarian rule.

## Digital Citizenship

In today's interconnected world, citizenship extends to the digital realm. Digital citizenship refers to the responsible use of technology and participation in online communities.

### Rights and Responsibilities Online

Digital citizens have rights and responsibilities similar to those in the physical world:
1. **Freedom of Expression**: Citizens can express their views online but should do so responsibly.
2. **Privacy**: Citizens have a right to privacy but must also respect others' privacy.
3. **Access to Information**: Citizens can access information online but should evaluate sources critically.
4. **Protection from Harassment**: Citizens should be protected from online harassment and should not harass others.

### Digital Literacy

Digital literacy—the ability to use digital technology effectively and responsibly—is increasingly important for citizenship. Digitally literate citizens can:
1. Find and evaluate online information
2. Protect their personal data and privacy
3. Recognize and avoid online scams and misinformation
4. Communicate effectively and respectfully online
5. Use digital tools for civic engagement

### Online Civic Engagement

The internet and social media provide new opportunities for civic engagement:
1. **Online Activism**: Citizens can raise awareness about issues, organize protests, and advocate for change online.
2. **E-Government**: Citizens can access government services, submit forms, and communicate with officials online.
3. **Crowdsourcing**: Citizens can collaborate on community projects and problem-solving through online platforms.
4. **Digital Petitions**: Citizens can create and sign online petitions to express their views on issues.

## Conclusion

Citizenship in a representative democracy like the United States comes with both rights and responsibilities. By fulfilling their duties, staying informed, voting, participating in their communities, and respecting others' rights, citizens help maintain a strong democratic system. The ways citizens influence government—through political parties, interest groups, direct contact with officials, and public opinion—are essential to the functioning of democracy.

Understanding citizenship in different societies helps us appreciate the freedoms and opportunities we have in democratic systems. It also reminds us that these freedoms depend on citizens' active participation and commitment to democratic values.

As technology continues to evolve, digital citizenship is becoming an increasingly important aspect of civic life. By practicing responsible digital citizenship, we can extend democratic values and practices to online spaces and use digital tools to strengthen our communities and democracy.
