# Lesson 1: Origins of Judaism

## The Big Idea
The Israelites formed a great kingdom in Israel and started a religion called Judaism.

## Main Ideas
- The Jews' early history began in Canaan and ended when the Romans forced them out of Israel.
- Jewish beliefs in God, justice, and righteousness are based on the Torah.
- Jewish traditions and holy days celebrate their history and beliefs.

## If YOU lived there...
You and your family are herders, looking after large flocks of sheep. Your grandfather is the leader of your tribe. One day your grandfather says that your whole family will be moving to a new country where there is more water and food for your flocks. The trip will be long and difficult.

**How do you feel about going to a new land?**

## Early History

### The Hebrews
Judaism began with a group of people called Hebrews. According to the Torah, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, the history of the Hebrews began with a man named Abraham. Abraham lived in Mesopotamia around 1800 BCE, in a city called Ur.

According to Jewish tradition, God spoke to Abraham and told him to move to Canaan, a land on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. God promised that Abraham's descendants would one day rule Canaan. In return, Abraham and his descendants would worship only God. This agreement between God and Abraham is called a covenant.

Abraham did move to Canaan with his family. His grandson Jacob had 12 sons, whose families became the 12 tribes of Israel. The Hebrews were also called Israelites after Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel.

### The Exodus
According to the Torah, the Israelites moved to Egypt to escape a famine in Canaan. At first they were welcomed, but later they were enslaved by the Egyptians. After many years of slavery, a leader named Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt. This event is called the Exodus.

During the Exodus, the Israelites wandered in the desert for 40 years. During this time, Moses received a set of laws from God on Mount Sinai. These laws included the Ten Commandments, which became the basis for Jewish religious and moral instruction. The Ten Commandments include rules such as "Do not steal" and "Do not murder."

### The Kingdom of Israel
After the Exodus, the Israelites returned to Canaan. At first, they were organized into 12 separate tribes. Later, they united under a series of kings. The first king was Saul, followed by David, who established Jerusalem as the capital city.

David's son Solomon built a great temple in Jerusalem. This temple, known as the First Temple, became the center of Jewish religious life. After Solomon's death, the kingdom split into two parts: Israel in the north and Judah in the south.

### Exile and Return
In 722 BCE, the Assyrians conquered the northern kingdom of Israel. Many Israelites were forced to leave their homeland. In 586 BCE, the Babylonians conquered the southern kingdom of Judah and destroyed the First Temple. Many Jews were taken to Babylon as captives.

This period, known as the Babylonian Exile, was a difficult time for the Jews. However, it was also a time when they strengthened their religious identity. They began to gather in places called synagogues to study and pray.

In 539 BCE, the Persian king Cyrus conquered Babylon and allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem. They rebuilt the temple, which became known as the Second Temple.

### Roman Rule and Diaspora
In 63 BCE, the Romans conquered Judea (as the Jewish homeland was then called). At first, they allowed the Jews to practice their religion. However, tensions grew between the Romans and the Jews.

In 66 CE, the Jews revolted against Roman rule. The Romans crushed the revolt and, in 70 CE, destroyed the Second Temple. Only one wall of the temple remained standing. This wall, known as the Western Wall, is still a sacred site for Jews today.

After another Jewish revolt in 132 CE, the Romans forced most Jews to leave Judea. The Jews spread throughout the Roman Empire and beyond, settling in Europe, North Africa, and Asia. This scattering of the Jewish people is known as the Diaspora.

Despite being scattered, the Jews maintained their religious identity and traditions. They continued to study the Torah and to practice their religion in synagogues.

## Jewish Beliefs

### Monotheism
The most important belief in Judaism is that there is only one God. This belief, called monotheism, was revolutionary in the ancient world, where most people were polytheistic (believing in many gods).

According to Jewish belief, God created the world and everything in it. God is all-knowing and all-powerful, but also just and merciful. God cares about human beings and has a special relationship with the Jewish people through the covenant made with Abraham.

### Justice and Righteousness
Judaism places a strong emphasis on justice and righteousness. Jews are expected to treat others fairly and to help those in need. The Hebrew prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, often criticized the Israelites when they failed to live up to these ideals.

The concept of tikkun olam, or "repairing the world," is an important part of Jewish ethics. It suggests that Jews have a responsibility to work toward a more just and peaceful world.

### The Torah and Other Sacred Texts
The Torah is the most sacred text in Judaism. It contains the first five books of the Hebrew Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. According to tradition, God gave the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai.

The Torah includes the story of creation, the history of the early Israelites, and many laws and teachings. The Ten Commandments are found in the Torah, as are laws about worship, diet, business practices, and many other aspects of life.

In addition to the Torah, other important Jewish texts include:

- The rest of the Hebrew Bible, which includes historical books, poetry, and the writings of the prophets
- The Talmud, a collection of commentaries on the Torah written by rabbis (Jewish teachers) over many centuries
- Various prayer books and commentaries used in worship and study

### The Messiah
Many Jews believe that God will send a Messiah (a savior or anointed one) who will bring peace and justice to the world. The Messiah will be a descendant of King David and will rule over Israel.

Different groups of Jews have different ideas about the Messiah. Some believe the Messiah will be a human leader, while others see the concept more symbolically, as representing an age of peace and justice.

## Jewish Traditions

### Worship and Prayer
For centuries, the Temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship. Priests offered sacrifices there on behalf of the people. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, worship shifted to synagogues, where Jews gathered to pray and study.

Today, Jews may pray individually, but many prayers require a minyan, a group of at least ten Jewish adults. Traditional Jewish men pray three times a day: morning, afternoon, and evening.

### Holy Days and Festivals
Judaism has many holy days and festivals that commemorate important events in Jewish history and express key religious beliefs:

- **Passover** celebrates the Exodus from Egypt. Families gather for a special meal called a Seder, during which they retell the story of the Exodus.

- **Rosh Hashanah** is the Jewish New Year, a time for reflection and renewal.

- **Yom Kippur**, the Day of Atonement, is the holiest day of the Jewish year. Jews fast for 24 hours, pray, and ask God for forgiveness for their sins.

- **Hanukkah** commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple after a successful Jewish revolt against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE.

- **Purim** celebrates the story told in the Book of Esther, in which the Jewish people in Persia were saved from destruction.

- **Sukkot** is a harvest festival during which Jews build temporary shelters to remember the Israelites' journey through the desert.

### Dietary Laws
Many Jews follow dietary laws called kashrut. Food that complies with these laws is called kosher. Some of the rules include:

- Not eating certain animals, such as pigs and shellfish
- Only eating meat from animals that have been slaughtered according to specific rituals
- Not mixing meat and dairy products in the same meal

These laws are based on commandments found in the Torah.

### Life Cycle Events
Judaism marks important life transitions with special ceremonies:

- **Brit milah** (circumcision) is performed on baby boys when they are eight days old, symbolizing their entry into the covenant with God.

- **Bar/Bat Mitzvah** marks the transition to religious adulthood at age 13 for boys and 12 or 13 for girls.

- **Marriage** is considered a sacred covenant and is celebrated with a ceremony under a chuppah (wedding canopy).

- **Death and mourning** are marked by specific rituals, including sitting shiva (a seven-day mourning period) after the death of a close relative.

### High Holy Days
The two most sacred of all Jewish holidays are the High Holy Days. They take place in September or October. The first two days of celebration, Rosh Hashanah (rahsh uh-SHAH-nuh), celebrate the start of a new year in the Jewish calendar.

On Yom Kippur (yohm ki-POOHR), which falls soon afterward, Jews ask God to forgive their sins. Jews consider Yom Kippur to be the holiest day of the entire year. Because it is so holy, Jews do not eat or drink anything all day. They also pray, reflect on the past year, and resolve to improve.

## Summary
Judaism was the world's first monotheistic religion. Jewish culture and traditions are rooted in the history of the Hebrews and Israelites. The religion emphasizes belief in one God, ethical behavior, and the study of sacred texts. Despite centuries of persecution and dispersion, Jews have maintained their religious identity and traditions.
