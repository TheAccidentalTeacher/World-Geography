## Main Ideas
- The life and death of Jesus of Nazareth inspired a new religion called Christianity.
- Christians believe that Jesus' acts and teachings focused on love and salvation.
- Jesus' followers taught others about Christianity, and it eventually became the official religion of the Roman Empire.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a fisher in Judea, bringing in the day's catch. As you reach the shore, you see a large crowd. They are listening to a man tell stories. A man in the crowd whispers to you that the speaker is a teacher with some new ideas about religion. You are eager to get your fish to the market, but you are also curious.

## Jesus of Nazareth

Jesus of Nazareth was the man many people believed was the Messiah—a great leader the ancient Jews predicted would come to save them. Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in Judea, around 4 BCE. He grew up in the town of Nazareth in Galilee, a region in northern Israel. Little is known about Jesus' early life, but according to the Gospels (accounts of Jesus' life written by his followers), he began teaching and preaching around the age of 30.

### Jesus' Ministry

Jesus traveled throughout Galilee and Judea, teaching in synagogues and in the open air. He gathered a group of followers, including 12 close disciples. His ministry lasted about three years.

Jesus' teachings were rooted in Judaism, but they also introduced new ideas. He emphasized the importance of love, forgiveness, and humility. He taught that God's kingdom was coming soon and that people should prepare by repenting of their sins and living according to God's will.

### Conflict with Authorities

Jesus' teachings sometimes brought him into conflict with Jewish religious leaders. Some of these leaders felt that Jesus was challenging their authority or interpreting Jewish law in ways they considered incorrect. Jesus also criticized what he saw as corruption and hypocrisy among some religious leaders.

The Roman authorities, who ruled Judea at the time, were also concerned about Jesus. They worried that his growing popularity might lead to political unrest. According to the Gospels, the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, ordered Jesus' execution by crucifixion, a common Roman method of execution at the time.

### The Resurrection

According to Christian belief, Jesus was crucified but rose from the dead three days later. This event, known as the Resurrection, is central to Christian faith. Christians believe that Jesus' resurrection demonstrated his divine nature and his victory over sin and death.

Christians further believe that after the Resurrection, Jesus appeared to some groups of his disciples, or followers. Jesus stayed with these disciples for the next 40 days, teaching them and giving them instructions about how to pass on his teachings.

After these 40 days, according to Christian tradition, Jesus ascended to heaven. Before leaving, he instructed his disciples to spread his teachings throughout the world. This event is known as the Great Commission.

## Christian Beliefs

### Jesus as the Messiah

Christians believe that Jesus was the Messiah promised in Jewish prophecy. The Greek word for Messiah is "Christ," which is why Jesus is often called Jesus Christ. However, Christians understand the role of the Messiah differently than many Jews of Jesus' time did. While many Jews expected a political leader who would free them from Roman rule, Christians believe that Jesus came to save people from sin and death.

Christians believe that Jesus was not just a human teacher but also the Son of God, divine in nature. They believe that he was born of a virgin named Mary through the power of the Holy Spirit.

### Salvation

A central concept in Christianity is salvation. Christians believe that humans are separated from God by sin (wrongdoing or disobedience to God). They believe that Jesus' death on the cross was a sacrifice that paid the penalty for human sin, making it possible for people to be reconciled with God.

According to Christian teaching, people can receive salvation—forgiveness of sins and eternal life with God—by believing in Jesus and accepting his sacrifice on their behalf. This concept is often summarized in a famous verse from the Gospel of John: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).

### The Trinity

Many Christians believe in the Trinity, the idea that God exists as three persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. These three persons are distinct but are all fully God, forming one God in three persons. This concept developed over time and was formally defined by church councils in the 4th century CE.

### Love and Compassion

Jesus emphasized the importance of love in his teachings. When asked which commandment was the greatest, he replied: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself" (Matthew 22:37-39).

Jesus also taught his followers to love their enemies, to forgive those who wronged them, and to show compassion to the poor, the sick, and the marginalized. These teachings have inspired Christians throughout history to engage in charitable work and to advocate for social justice.

## Jesus' Acts and Teachings

### Miracles

According to the Gospels, Jesus performed many miracles during his ministry. These included healing the sick, casting out demons, controlling nature (such as calming a storm), and even raising the dead. Christians believe that these miracles demonstrated Jesus' divine power and his compassion for those who were suffering.

One of Jesus' most famous miracles was the feeding of the 5,000. According to the Gospels, Jesus fed a crowd of 5,000 men (plus women and children) with just five loaves of bread and two fish. After everyone had eaten their fill, there were 12 baskets of leftovers.

### Parables

Jesus often taught using parables—simple stories that conveyed spiritual truths. These stories used familiar settings and situations to illustrate deeper spiritual principles. Some of Jesus' most famous parables include:

- **The Good Samaritan**: A story about a man who helps a stranger from a different ethnic group, illustrating the command to "love your neighbor as yourself."
- **The Prodigal Son**: A story about a father who forgives his wayward son, illustrating God's forgiveness and love.
- **The Sower**: A story about a farmer sowing seeds, illustrating how people respond differently to God's message.

### The Sermon on the Mount

One of Jesus' most famous teachings is the Sermon on the Mount, recorded in the Gospel of Matthew (chapters 5-7). In this sermon, Jesus presented a vision of God's kingdom that often contrasted with conventional wisdom. He began with the Beatitudes, a series of blessings for those who are humble, merciful, and peacemakers.

In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus also taught his followers to pray using what is now known as the Lord's Prayer. He encouraged them not to worry about material possessions but to "seek first the kingdom of God." He also taught them not to judge others harshly and to treat others as they would want to be treated (the Golden Rule).

## The Spread of Christianity

### The Early Church

After Jesus' ascension, his disciples began to spread his teachings. According to the book of Acts in the New Testament, the disciples received the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, which gave them the ability to speak in different languages. This enabled them to share Jesus' message with people from many different regions who had gathered in Jerusalem for a Jewish festival.

The early Christian community in Jerusalem shared their possessions and met regularly for teaching, fellowship, and prayer. They faced persecution from some Jewish authorities who saw Christianity as a dangerous deviation from traditional Judaism.

### Paul's Missionary Journeys

One of the most important figures in the spread of early Christianity was Paul of Tarsus. Originally a persecutor of Christians, Paul had a dramatic conversion experience on the road to Damascus, after which he became a fervent follower of Jesus.

Paul undertook several missionary journeys throughout the eastern Mediterranean region, establishing Christian communities in cities such as Ephesus, Philippi, Corinth, and Thessalonica. He wrote letters (epistles) to these communities, many of which are now part of the New Testament.

Paul's approach to spreading Christianity was significant because he taught that non-Jews (Gentiles) could become Christians without first converting to Judaism or following Jewish laws such as circumcision. This made Christianity more accessible to people throughout the Roman Empire.

### Organization of the Early Church

As Christianity spread, it developed organizational structures. Local communities were led by elders (presbyters) and overseers (bishops). Deacons were appointed to help with practical matters such as caring for the poor.

By the 2nd century CE, the role of bishops had become more prominent. Each major city had a bishop who oversaw the Christian communities in that area. Some bishops, particularly those in cities with apostolic connections (cities where apostles had worked), had special authority.

The early church also developed creeds (statements of belief) to ensure consistency of teaching and to distinguish orthodox (correct) beliefs from heretical (incorrect) ones.

### Persecution and Growth

For the first three centuries of its existence, Christianity was often persecuted by Roman authorities. Christians were sometimes arrested, tortured, and executed for refusing to worship the Roman gods or the emperor. Famous martyrs (people who died for their faith) included Ignatius of Antioch, Polycarp of Smyrna, and Perpetua and Felicity.

Despite persecution, Christianity continued to grow. The courage of the martyrs impressed many observers, and the Christian message of love, forgiveness, and eternal life appealed to people throughout the Roman Empire. Christians also gained a reputation for caring for the poor and the sick, including during times of plague when others fled.

### Constantine and the Acceptance of Christianity

In the early 4th century CE, a significant event changed things for Christians in Rome. The emperor himself became a Christian.

The emperor who became a Christian was Constantine. According to legend, Constantine was preparing for battle against a rival when he saw a cross in the sky. He thought that this vision meant he would win the battle if he converted to Christianity. Constantine did convert, and he won the battle. As a result of his victory, he became the new emperor of Rome.

As emperor, Constantine removed bans against the practice of Christianity. He also called together a council of Christian leaders from around the empire to try to clarify Christian teachings. Almost 60 years after Constantine died, another emperor banned all non-Christian religious practices in the empire. Christianity eventually spread from Rome to all around the world.

## Summary

The life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth inspired a new religion among the Jews. This religion was Christianity. Jesus' message of love, forgiveness, and salvation attracted followers during his lifetime and continued to spread after his death and resurrection. Despite initial persecution, Christianity grew throughout the Roman Empire and eventually became its official religion. From there, it spread throughout the world and became one of the largest religions globally.
