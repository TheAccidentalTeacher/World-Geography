# Lesson 3: Origins of Islam

## The Big Idea
Islam, a religion based on the teachings of Muhammad, arose in Arabia and is based on the sacred texts called the Qur'an and the Sunnah.

## Main Ideas
- Arabia is mostly a desert land, where two ways of life, nomadic and sedentary, developed.
- A new religion called Islam, based on the teachings of the prophet Muhammad, developed in Arabia.
- The Qur'an, the Sunnah, and Islamic law guide Muslims in their daily lives.

## If YOU lived there...
Your family owns an inn in Mecca. Usually business is pretty calm, but this week your inn is packed. Travelers have come from all over the world to visit your city. One morning you leave the inn and are swept up in a huge crowd of these visitors. They speak many different languages, but everyone is wearing the same white robes. They are headed to the mosque.

**What might draw so many people to your city?**

## Life in a Desert Land

The Arabian Peninsula, or Arabia, is located in Southwest Asia. It is a harsh, dry land, with few rivers and little rainfall. Most of Arabia is covered by desert, making it a challenging environment for human settlement.

### Geography and Climate

Arabia is bordered by the Red Sea to the west, the Arabian Sea to the south, and the Persian Gulf to the east. The interior of the peninsula is dominated by vast deserts, including the Rub' al-Khali (Empty Quarter), one of the largest sand deserts in the world.

The climate is extremely hot and dry, with temperatures often exceeding 100°F (38°C) during the day. Rainfall is scarce and unpredictable, making agriculture difficult in most areas.

### Two Ways of Life

Due to the harsh desert environment, two distinct ways of life developed in ancient Arabia:

#### Nomadic Life

Many Arabs lived as nomads, constantly moving from place to place in search of water and grazing land for their animals. These nomadic Arabs, known as Bedouins, raised camels, sheep, and goats. They lived in tents that could be easily packed up and moved.

The Bedouins were organized into tribes, with strong family and clan loyalties. They developed a rich oral tradition of poetry and storytelling. They were known for their hospitality to travelers and their skill as warriors.

#### Sedentary Life

In areas where water was more readily available, such as oases and coastal regions, Arabs established permanent settlements. These sedentary Arabs engaged in agriculture, growing dates, grains, and other crops. They also developed trade networks that connected Arabia to surrounding regions.

Important towns developed at oases and along trade routes. These towns became centers of commerce and culture. One of the most important towns was Mecca, which was located at the crossroads of several major trade routes.

### Mecca: A Center of Trade and Religion

Mecca was not only an important trading center but also a religious site. It was home to the Kaaba, a cube-shaped building that housed hundreds of idols representing the gods worshipped by various Arab tribes. Arabs from throughout the peninsula would make pilgrimages to Mecca to worship at the Kaaba.

The tribe that controlled Mecca, the Quraysh, became wealthy and powerful through trade and by managing the pilgrimage traffic. They established agreements with other tribes to ensure safe passage for traders and pilgrims.

## The Prophet Muhammad and the Origins of Islam

### Early Life of Muhammad

Muhammad was born in Mecca around 570 CE to a family of the Quraysh tribe. His father died before his birth, and his mother died when he was six years old. He was raised first by his grandfather and then by his uncle.

As a young man, Muhammad worked as a merchant and gained a reputation for honesty and integrity. At the age of 25, he married a wealthy widow named Khadijah, who was 15 years his senior. Their marriage was happy and lasted until Khadijah's death 25 years later.

### The First Revelation

According to Islamic tradition, when Muhammad was about 40 years old, he began to retreat to a cave on Mount Hira near Mecca to meditate and pray. During one of these retreats, in the year 610 CE, he received his first revelation from God through the angel Gabriel.

Muhammad was initially frightened by this experience, but Khadijah reassured him and became the first person to accept his message. Over the next 23 years, Muhammad continued to receive revelations, which were later compiled into the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam.

### Muhammad's Message

Muhammad began to preach a message of strict monotheism—belief in one God, whom he called Allah (the Arabic word for God). He criticized the polytheism (worship of many gods) that was common in Arabia at the time. He also called for social reforms, including better treatment of the poor, orphans, and women.

Key elements of Muhammad's message included:

- There is only one God (Allah), who is all-powerful and merciful
- People should submit to God's will (the word "Islam" means "submission" in Arabic)
- There will be a Day of Judgment when all people will be held accountable for their actions
- Those who believe in God and do good deeds will be rewarded with paradise, while those who reject God will be punished

### Opposition and Migration to Medina

Muhammad's message was not well-received by many Meccans, especially the leaders of the Quraysh tribe. They saw his teachings as a threat to their religious practices and economic interests, since the pilgrimage trade was a major source of income for Mecca.

As opposition to Muhammad grew, he and his followers faced increasing persecution. In 622 CE, Muhammad and his followers migrated to the city of Yathrib, about 280 miles north of Mecca. This migration, known as the Hijrah, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar.

Yathrib was later renamed Medina (meaning "the city"), short for "Madinat al-Nabi" (City of the Prophet). In Medina, Muhammad established the first Muslim community and served as both a religious and political leader.

### Return to Mecca

Over the next several years, tensions between the Muslims in Medina and the Quraysh in Mecca led to several battles. Eventually, in 630 CE, Muhammad returned to Mecca with a large force of followers. The Meccans surrendered without a fight, and Muhammad showed remarkable forgiveness toward those who had previously persecuted him.

Muhammad removed the idols from the Kaaba and rededicated it to the worship of Allah alone. He established Mecca as the center of Islamic worship, a status it retains to this day.

By the time of Muhammad's death in 632 CE, most of the Arabian Peninsula had accepted Islam, and the religion was poised to spread beyond Arabia's borders.

## Islamic Beliefs and Practices

### The Five Pillars of Islam

The Five Pillars of Islam are the core practices that all Muslims are expected to follow:

1. **Shahada (Declaration of Faith)**: The statement "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah." This declaration is the foundation of Islamic belief.

2. **Salat (Prayer)**: Muslims are required to pray five times a day—at dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset, and night. These prayers involve specific physical movements and recitations from the Qur'an.

3. **Zakat (Almsgiving)**: Muslims are obligated to give a portion of their wealth to the poor and needy. This is typically calculated as 2.5% of a person's savings and assets above a certain minimum amount.

4. **Sawm (Fasting)**: During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs. This practice teaches self-discipline and empathy for those who are less fortunate.

5. **Hajj (Pilgrimage)**: Muslims who are physically and financially able are required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime. The Hajj involves a series of rituals that commemorate events in the lives of Abraham and his family.

### The Qur'an

The Qur'an is the holy book of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the literal word of God as revealed to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. The word "Qur'an" means "recitation" in Arabic, reflecting its origins as an oral revelation.

The Qur'an consists of 114 chapters (suras) of varying length. It covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Theological teachings about God, angels, prophets, and the afterlife
- Moral and ethical guidelines for personal conduct
- Legal principles for governing society
- Stories of earlier prophets, many of whom are also found in Jewish and Christian traditions
- Descriptions of paradise and hell

Muslims believe that the Qur'an is the final revelation from God, completing and correcting earlier revelations given to prophets such as Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.

### The Sunnah

The Sunnah refers to the practices, teachings, and examples of Muhammad. It is considered the second most important source of guidance for Muslims after the Qur'an.

The Sunnah is preserved in collections of hadith—reports of Muhammad's sayings, actions, and approvals. These reports were carefully collected and evaluated by Muslim scholars in the centuries after Muhammad's death.

The Sunnah provides practical guidance on how to apply the principles of the Qur'an in daily life. It covers topics such as:

- How to perform religious rituals correctly
- How to conduct business transactions ethically
- How to treat family members and neighbors
- How to resolve disputes

### Islamic Art and Architecture

Islamic art and architecture developed distinctive styles that reflected the religion's emphasis on monotheism and its prohibition of idolatry. Since depicting humans and animals was discouraged in religious contexts (to avoid any hint of idol worship), Islamic artists developed other forms of expression:

- **Calligraphy**: The art of beautiful writing became highly developed in Islamic cultures. Verses from the Qur'an were inscribed on buildings, textiles, and objects in elaborate calligraphic styles.

- **Geometric Patterns**: Complex geometric designs, often based on mathematical principles, adorned mosques, palaces, and everyday objects.

- **Arabesque**: This style featured intricate patterns of intertwined plant forms, creating a sense of infinite pattern that symbolized the infinite nature of God.

Islamic architecture is perhaps best exemplified by the mosque, the Muslim house of worship. Key features of mosque architecture include:

- The mihrab, a niche in the wall indicating the direction of Mecca
- The minaret, a tall tower from which the call to prayer is announced
- The dome, symbolizing the vault of heaven
- Courtyards for ablutions (ritual washing) before prayer

## Islamic Law and Daily Life

### Development of Islamic Law

Islamic law, known as Shariah, is a comprehensive system of ethics and jurisprudence based on the Qur'an and the Sunnah. The word "Shariah" literally means "the way" or "the path."

After Muhammad's death, as Islam spread to new regions with different cultures and customs, Muslims faced new questions and challenges not directly addressed in the Qur'an or Sunnah. To address these issues, Islamic scholars developed a system of jurisprudence (fiqh) based on:

- Direct commands from the Qur'an
- Practices established by Muhammad (Sunnah)
- Consensus of qualified scholars (ijma)
- Reasoning by analogy (qiyas)

Different schools of legal thought emerged, each with its own methodology for interpreting and applying Islamic principles to new situations.

### Guidance for Daily Life

Shariah provides guidance for virtually all aspects of life, including:

- Religious practices and rituals
- Family law (marriage, divorce, inheritance)
- Business and financial transactions
- Criminal law
- International relations
- Personal conduct and ethics

Shariah sets rewards for good behavior and punishments for crimes. It also describes limits of authority. It was the basis for law in Muslim countries until modern times. Today, though, most Muslim countries blend Islamic law with legal systems like those in the United States or western Europe.

Islamic law is not found in one book. Instead, it is a set of opinions and writings that have changed over the centuries. As a result, different ideas about Islamic law are found in different Muslim regions.

## Comparison of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam

These three religions, often called the Abrahamic faiths because they all trace their origins to Abraham, share many similarities but also have important differences:

### Similarities

- **Monotheism**: All three religions believe in one God who created the universe and continues to be involved in human affairs.
- **Prophets**: All three recognize many of the same prophets, including Abraham, Moses, and others from the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament.
- **Ethical Teachings**: All three emphasize the importance of ethical behavior, justice, and compassion.
- **Sacred Texts**: All three have sacred texts that they believe contain divine revelation.
- **Day of Judgment**: All three believe in some form of final judgment and afterlife.

### Differences

- **View of Jesus**: Jews see Jesus as a historical figure but not the Messiah. Christians believe Jesus is the Son of God and the Messiah. Muslims regard Jesus as a prophet but not divine.
- **View of Muhammad**: Muslims accept Muhammad as God's final prophet. Jews and Christians do not recognize Muhammad as a prophet.
- **Sacred Texts**: Jews focus on the Torah and other Hebrew scriptures. Christians accept these texts (as the Old Testament) but add the New Testament. Muslims have the Qur'an and consider earlier scriptures to have been partially corrupted over time.
- **Religious Practices**: Each religion has its own distinctive religious practices and holy days.
- **Concept of Salvation**: Each religion has different understandings of how humans can achieve salvation or a right relationship with God.

## Summary

In the early 600s, Islam was introduced to Arabia by Muhammad. The Qur'an, the Sunnah, and Shariah teach Muslims how to live. Islam shares some similarities with Judaism and Christianity, as all three are monotheistic religions with roots in the Middle East, but each has its own distinct beliefs, practices, and traditions.
