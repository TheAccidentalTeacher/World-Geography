# Lesson 2: Egypt

## The Big Idea
Egypt is rich in history and Islamic culture.

## Main Ideas
- Egyptian civilization goes back thousands of years.
- Many of Egypt's people are farmers and live along the Nile River.
- Egypt's culture reflects its Islamic heritage.

## If YOU lived there...
You live in a village in ancient Egypt in about 800 BC. Your family grows wheat and date palms along the banks of the Nile River, which brings water for your crops. You and your friends like to explore the marshy areas along the banks of the river, where many kinds of birds live in the tall reeds.

**How is the Nile River important in your life?**

## Egypt's Nile River valley was home to some of the world's earliest civilizations. Today, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa and a leader in the Arab world.

## Ancient Egypt

### Early Civilization

Egyptian civilization began more than 5,000 years ago along the banks of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians developed a complex society with a powerful central government, a sophisticated writing system, and monumental architecture.

The Nile River was essential to the development of ancient Egyptian civilization. Its annual floods deposited rich silt on the surrounding land, making agriculture possible in an otherwise desert environment. The river also provided a means of transportation and communication throughout the kingdom.

Ancient Egypt was ruled by pharaohs, who were considered divine rulers with absolute power. The society was highly organized, with a clear social hierarchy:
- The pharaoh at the top
- Nobles and priests
- Scribes and artisans
- Farmers and laborers
- Slaves at the bottom

### Cultural Achievements

The ancient Egyptians made significant contributions to human knowledge and culture:

**Writing**: They developed a writing system called hieroglyphics, which used pictorial symbols to represent words and sounds. This allowed them to record their history, religious beliefs, and administrative information.

**Architecture**: The Egyptians built impressive monuments, including pyramids, temples, and palaces. The Great Pyramid of Giza, built around 2560 BCE, is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.

**Art**: Egyptian art was highly stylized and symbolic, with strict conventions for depicting the human figure. Paintings and sculptures often showed people in profile with the eye facing forward.

**Mathematics and Astronomy**: The Egyptians developed sophisticated mathematical knowledge, which they used for surveying land, building monuments, and tracking the movements of celestial bodies.

**Medicine**: Egyptian physicians were renowned throughout the ancient world. They developed treatments for various ailments and performed basic surgical procedures.

### Religious Beliefs

Religion was central to ancient Egyptian life. They believed in many gods and goddesses who controlled different aspects of nature and human affairs. Some of the most important deities included:
- Ra, the sun god
- Osiris, god of the afterlife
- Isis, goddess of magic and motherhood
- Horus, god of the sky
- Anubis, god of embalming and the dead

The Egyptians believed in an afterlife and developed elaborate burial practices to ensure a person's successful journey to the next world. Mummification preserved the body, while tombs were filled with possessions the deceased would need in the afterlife.

## Egypt Through History

### Foreign Rule

Throughout its long history, Egypt has been ruled by various foreign powers:

**Persian Rule (525-332 BCE)**: The Persian Empire conquered Egypt and incorporated it into their vast domain.

**Greek and Roman Rule (332 BCE-642 CE)**: After Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, the Ptolemaic dynasty (of Greek origin) ruled the country. The last ruler of this dynasty was Cleopatra VII. After her death, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire.

**Arab Conquest and Islamic Era (642-1517 CE)**: Arab armies conquered Egypt, bringing Islam to the region. Over time, most Egyptians converted to Islam, and Arabic became the dominant language.

**Ottoman Rule (1517-1867 CE)**: Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire, though it maintained some autonomy under local rulers.

**European Influence (19th-20th centuries)**: In the 19th century, European powers, particularly Britain and France, became increasingly involved in Egyptian affairs. Britain established a protectorate over Egypt in 1914.

### Modern Egypt

Egypt gained independence from Britain in 1922, though British influence remained strong until the 1950s. In 1952, a group of military officers led by Gamal Abdel Nasser overthrew the monarchy and established a republic.

Under Nasser's leadership (1954-1970), Egypt pursued policies of Arab nationalism, socialism, and non-alignment in the Cold War. Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal in 1956, leading to the Suez Crisis, a brief military conflict involving Egypt, Israel, Britain, and France.

Nasser's successor, Anwar Sadat (1970-1981), shifted Egypt's foreign policy. After the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, Sadat pursued peace with Israel, culminating in the 1978 Camp David Accords and the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. For these efforts, Sadat shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. However, the peace treaty was controversial in the Arab world, and Sadat was assassinated by Islamic extremists in 1981.

Hosni Mubarak became president after Sadat's assassination and ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years. His government maintained the peace treaty with Israel and close ties with the United States, but faced criticism for corruption, human rights abuses, and lack of democratic reforms.

### The Arab Spring and Recent Developments

In January 2011, massive protests erupted in Egypt as part of the broader Arab Spring movement. After 18 days of demonstrations, Mubarak resigned, ending his 30-year rule.

In the aftermath, Egypt held its first free presidential election in 2012, which was won by Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. However, Morsi's rule was short-lived. Amid growing discontent with his leadership and policies, the military, led by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, removed Morsi from power in July 2013.

El-Sisi was elected president in 2014 and has remained in power since then. His government has been criticized for human rights abuses and restrictions on political freedom, but supporters argue that he has brought stability to Egypt and implemented needed economic reforms.

## Egypt Today

### Population and Settlement

Egypt has a population of over 100 million people, making it the most populous country in North Africa and the Arab world. The population is growing rapidly, creating challenges for housing, employment, and public services.

The vast majority of Egyptians (about 95%) live along the Nile River valley and delta, which make up only about 5% of Egypt's total land area. This creates one of the highest population densities in the world in these habitable areas.

Cairo, the capital, is one of the largest cities in Africa and the Middle East, with a metropolitan population of over 20 million people. Other major cities include Alexandria, Giza, and Luxor.

### Economy

Egypt has a mixed economy with both public and private sectors. Key economic sectors include:

**Agriculture**: Despite limited arable land, agriculture remains an important part of Egypt's economy. Major crops include cotton, rice, corn, wheat, and fruits. The Nile River and its delta provide water for irrigation.

**Tourism**: Egypt's rich historical heritage and archaeological sites, such as the Pyramids of Giza, the Sphinx, and the temples of Luxor, attract millions of tourists each year. Tourism is a major source of foreign currency, though it is vulnerable to regional instability and security concerns.

**Oil and Natural Gas**: Egypt has significant reserves of oil and natural gas, which are important for both domestic consumption and export.

**Suez Canal**: The canal generates billions of dollars in revenue each year from shipping fees.

**Manufacturing**: Egypt has a growing manufacturing sector, producing textiles, food products, chemicals, and other goods.

Despite its resources and potential, Egypt faces economic challenges, including high unemployment (especially among youth), inflation, and a large public debt. The government has implemented economic reforms in recent years, including reducing subsidies and floating the currency, which have helped stabilize the economy but have also caused hardship for many Egyptians.

### Culture

Egypt's culture is a rich blend of ancient heritage and Islamic traditions, with influences from various civilizations that have ruled the country throughout its long history.

**Language**: Arabic is the official language of Egypt. The Egyptian dialect of Arabic is widely understood throughout the Arab world due to Egypt's cultural influence, particularly through cinema and television.

**Religion**: Islam is the predominant religion in Egypt, with about 90% of the population being Sunni Muslims. Christianity, primarily Coptic Orthodox, is practiced by about 10% of Egyptians. Religious traditions play an important role in daily life and social customs.

**Food**: Egyptian cuisine reflects the country's history and geography. Popular dishes include koshari (a mix of rice, lentils, and pasta topped with tomato sauce and fried onions), ful medames (mashed fava beans), and molokhia (a green soup made from jute leaves). Bread, particularly a flatbread called aish baladi, is a staple food.

**Holidays and Festivals**: Egyptians celebrate both religious and secular holidays. Major Islamic holidays include Eid al-Fitr (marking the end of Ramadan), Eid al-Adha (the Feast of Sacrifice), and Mawlid al-Nabi (the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad). Coptic Christians celebrate Christmas on January 7 and Easter according to the Julian calendar.

Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting, is observed by most Muslims in Egypt. During this month, Muslims abstain from food and drink from dawn to sunset. This holiday is marked with lights, parades, and special sweets of honey, nuts, and sugar.

**The Arts and Literature**: North Africa has a rich and varied tradition in the arts and literature, which Egypt shares. While traditional arts include woodcarving and weaving, Egypt also boasts a growing movie industry. Egyptian films in Arabic have become popular throughout Southwest Asia and North Africa.

Egypt has also produced important writers and artists. For example, Egyptian poetry and other writings date back thousands of years. One of Egypt's most famous writers is Naguib Mahfouz. In 1988 he became the first Arabic writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.

## Summary

Egypt has a rich and complex history spanning thousands of years, from the ancient pharaohs to the modern republic. The Nile River has been the lifeblood of Egyptian civilization, supporting agriculture and settlement in an otherwise desert environment. Today, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa, with a diverse economy and a culture that blends ancient traditions with Islamic heritage. Despite facing political and economic challenges, Egypt remains a cultural and political leader in the Arab world.
