# Lesson 3: Antarctica

## If YOU lived there...
You are a scientist working at a research laboratory in Antarctica. One day you receive an email message from a friend. She wants to open a company that will lead public tours through Antarctica so people can see its spectacular icy landscapes and wildlife. Some of your fellow scientists think that tours are a good idea, while others think that they could ruin the local environment.

**What will you tell your friend?**

## The Big Idea
Antarctica's unique environment has made it an important site for research.

## Main Ideas
- Freezing temperatures, ice, and snow dominate Antarctica's physical geography.
- Explorations in the 1800s and 1900s led to Antarctica's use for scientific research.
- Research and protecting the environment are key issues in Antarctica today.

## Key Terms and Places
- ice shelf
- icebergs
- Antarctic Peninsula
- polar desert
- ozone layer

## Physical Geography

In the southernmost part of the world is the continent of Antarctica. This frozen land is very different from any other place on Earth.

### The Land

Ice covers about 98 percent of Antarctica's 5.4 million square miles (14 million square km). This ice sheet contains about 90 percent of the world's ice. On average, the ice sheet is more than 1 mile (1.6 km) thick.

The weight of Antarctica's ice sheet causes ice to flow slowly off the continent. As the ice reaches the coast, it forms a ledge over the surrounding seas. This ledge of ice that extends over the water is called an ice shelf. Antarctica's ice shelves are huge. In fact, the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica's largest, is about the size of Canada's Yukon Territory.

Sometimes, parts of the ice shelf break off into the surrounding water. Floating masses of ice that have broken off a glacier are icebergs. Some Antarctic icebergs are enormous. For example, in 2000 an iceberg the size of Connecticut broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.

Antarctica has two main regions. East Antarctica is larger and has a higher elevation than West Antarctica. The Transantarctic Mountains separate the two regions. The Antarctic Peninsula extends from West Antarctica toward South America. This peninsula is the northernmost part of Antarctica and has a milder climate than the rest of the continent.

### Climate

Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. Winter temperatures can drop below -100°F (-73°C). Even in summer, temperatures rarely rise above freezing. Antarctica is also the windiest continent. Winds can reach speeds of more than 200 miles (322 km) per hour.

Antarctica is a polar desert, a region that receives very little precipitation. In fact, some parts of Antarctica receive less than 2 inches (5 cm) of precipitation per year. This makes Antarctica one of the driest places on Earth. The precipitation that does fall comes as snow.

Despite the harsh climate, Antarctica experiences seasons. During the Southern Hemisphere's summer (December to February), Antarctica has 24 hours of daylight. During winter (June to August), it has 24 hours of darkness.

### Wildlife

Antarctica's extreme climate makes it difficult for plants and animals to survive on land. No trees or shrubs grow on the continent. The only plants are mosses, lichens, and algae that can survive in the harsh conditions.

The surrounding ocean, however, is rich in life. Krill, small shrimp-like creatures, are abundant in Antarctic waters. They form the base of a food chain that includes fish, squid, seals, whales, and birds.

Several types of seals live in and around Antarctica, including Weddell seals, leopard seals, and elephant seals. Whales, such as blue whales, orcas, and humpback whales, feed in Antarctic waters during the summer.

Birds are the most visible wildlife in Antarctica. The most famous are penguins, which are flightless birds adapted to life in the water. Several penguin species live in Antarctica, including emperor penguins, Adélie penguins, and chinstrap penguins. Other birds, such as albatrosses and petrels, also inhabit the region.

## History

Antarctica was the last continent to be discovered and explored by humans. Its remote location and harsh climate kept it hidden from the outside world until relatively recently.

### Discovery and Exploration

For centuries, people speculated about the existence of a large southern continent. Ancient Greek geographers proposed that such a landmass must exist to balance the northern continents. However, it wasn't until the late 1700s that explorers began to venture into the far southern oceans.

British explorer James Cook circled Antarctica in the 1770s but never saw the continent itself. The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica occurred in 1820, though it's debated whether Russian, British, or American explorers were the first to spot it.

The first landing on the Antarctic mainland likely occurred in 1895, when Norwegian explorers Henryk Bull and Carsten Borchgrevink went ashore at Cape Adare. The early 1900s became known as the "Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration," as expeditions from several countries raced to explore the continent and reach the South Pole.

The most famous of these expeditions were led by Norwegian Roald Amundsen and British explorer Robert Falcon Scott. In December 1911, Amundsen and his team became the first to reach the South Pole. Scott's team arrived about a month later, only to find that Amundsen had beaten them. Tragically, Scott and his companions died on their return journey.

Another notable explorer was Ernest Shackleton, whose ship Endurance was crushed by ice in 1915. Despite being stranded, Shackleton led all of his men to safety in one of the greatest survival stories in history.

### Scientific Research

Scientific interest in Antarctica grew throughout the 20th century. In 1957-1958, twelve countries participated in the International Geophysical Year (IGY), a global scientific project that included extensive research in Antarctica. The success of this collaboration led to the Antarctic Treaty of 1959.

The Antarctic Treaty set aside the continent for peaceful scientific research. It prohibited military activities, weapons testing, and nuclear explosions. It also froze territorial claims, as several countries had claimed parts of Antarctica. The treaty has been remarkably successful and now has more than 50 signatory nations.

Today, about 30 countries operate scientific research stations in Antarctica. During the summer, thousands of scientists and support staff work on the continent. In winter, when conditions are most extreme, only a few hundred people remain.

## Antarctica Today

Antarctica continues to be an important site for scientific research and international cooperation. However, it also faces environmental challenges.

### Scientific Research

Antarctica provides unique opportunities for scientific research in many fields. Scientists study the continent's ice to learn about Earth's climate history. By drilling ice cores—cylinders of ice extracted from the ice sheet—researchers can analyze air bubbles trapped in the ice thousands of years ago. This provides valuable information about past climate conditions.

Antarctica is also an excellent place to study astronomy. The clear, dry air and lack of light pollution make it ideal for observing the stars. Several telescopes and observatories have been built on the continent.

The unique ecosystems of Antarctica and the surrounding ocean are of great interest to biologists. Researchers study how organisms have adapted to the extreme conditions and how they might be affected by climate change.

Antarctica is also used for medical research. The isolation and confinement experienced by people living at Antarctic research stations is similar to what astronauts might experience on long space missions. Studying how people cope with these conditions helps prepare for future space exploration.

### Environmental Issues

Antarctica faces several environmental challenges, many of them related to global climate change. The Antarctic Peninsula, in particular, has experienced significant warming in recent decades. This has led to the retreat of ice shelves and glaciers.

In 1995, a large portion of the Larsen A Ice Shelf collapsed. In 2002, most of the Larsen B Ice Shelf disintegrated. Scientists are concerned that continued warming could lead to the collapse of larger ice shelves, which could accelerate the flow of glaciers into the ocean and contribute to sea level rise.

Another environmental concern is the hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica. The ozone layer is a region of the upper atmosphere that protects Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. In the 1980s, scientists discovered that this layer was thinning over Antarctica due to human-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). International agreements have reduced the use of these chemicals, and the ozone hole has begun to recover, though it will take decades to fully heal.

Tourism is a growing industry in Antarctica, with tens of thousands of visitors each year. While tourism can raise awareness about Antarctica's importance, it also raises concerns about environmental impact. Tour operators must follow strict guidelines to minimize their impact on the fragile Antarctic environment.

### International Cooperation

Antarctica remains a model of international cooperation. The Antarctic Treaty System, which includes the original treaty and subsequent agreements, continues to govern activities on the continent. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1991, designates Antarctica as a "natural reserve devoted to peace and science" and prohibits mining and other resource extraction.

Regular meetings of the Antarctic Treaty nations address issues such as scientific cooperation, environmental protection, and tourism management. This cooperative approach has made Antarctica one of the most successfully managed international spaces.

## Social Studies Skills

### Make a Decision

Making decisions is an important life skill. When you make a decision, you choose between two or more options. The result of your choice is a consequence. Some consequences are positive, while others are negative.

Before you make a decision, consider all your possible options. Think about the possible consequences of each option and decide which will be best for you. Thinking about the consequences of your decision beforehand will allow you to make a better, more thoughtful decision.

#### Learn the Skill

Imagine your parents have given you the option of getting a new pet. Use a graphic organizer like the one on this page to help you decide whether to get one.

1. What are the consequences of getting a pet? Which of these consequences are positive? Which are negative?
2. What are the consequences of not getting a pet? Which of them are positive? Which are negative?
3. Compare your two options. Look at the positive and negative consequences of each option. Based on these consequences, do you think you should get a pet?

#### Practice the Skill

Imagine that you have the opportunity to journey into the Outback or join an expedition to the South Pole. You can only choose one of the destinations. Use a graphic organizer like the one on this page to consider the consequences of each option. Compare your lists, and then make your choice. Write a short paragraph to explain your decision.

## Summary and Preview

Antarctica is a unique continent dedicated to scientific research and international cooperation. Its extreme climate and isolation have preserved it as one of the last pristine environments on Earth. However, it faces challenges from climate change and human activities. The successful management of Antarctica through international agreements provides a model for addressing global environmental issues.
