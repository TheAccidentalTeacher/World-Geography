# Lesson 1: Australia and New Zealand

## If YOU lived there...
You have just taken a summer job working at a sheep station, or ranch, in Australia's Outback. You knew the Outback would be hot, but you did not realize how hot it could get! During the day, temperatures climb to over 100°F (40°C), and it hardly ever rains. In addition, you have learned that there are no towns nearby. Your only communication with home is by radio.

**How will you adapt to living in the Outback?**

## Physical Geography

Australia and New Zealand are quite unlike most places on Earth. The physical features, variety of climates, unusual wildlife, and plentiful resources make the region truly unique.

### Physical Features

The physical features of the region differ widely. Australia is home to wide, flat stretches of dry land. On the other hand, New Zealand features beautiful green hills and tall mountains.

#### Australia

Similar to an island, Australia is surrounded by water. However, due to its immense size—almost 3 million square miles (7.8 million square km)—geographers consider Australia a continent.

A huge plateau covers the western half of Australia. Mostly flat and dry, this plateau is home to Uluru, a rock formation also known as Ayers Rock. Uluru is one of Australia's best-known landforms. Low mountains, valleys, and a major river system cover much of eastern Australia. Fertile plains lie along the coasts. Most Australians live in this area because of the more favorable environment. Off Australia's northeastern coast is the Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef. A coral reef is a collection of rocky material found in shallow, tropical waters. The Great Barrier Reef is home to an incredible variety of marine animals.

#### New Zealand

New Zealand consists of two main islands—the North Island and the South Island—and many smaller islands. The country is located about 1,200 miles (1,931 km) southeast of Australia. New Zealand's islands are the peaks of underwater mountains. The North Island has several active volcanoes and many hot springs. The South Island features the Southern Alps, a mountain range with peaks that reach more than 12,000 feet (3,658 m) high. Glaciers, or slow-moving masses of ice, are found in the Southern Alps.

### Climate

The climates of Australia and New Zealand are as varied as their physical features.

#### Australia

Australia's climate ranges from tropical to temperate. The northern part of the country has a tropical climate with high temperatures and heavy rainfall. Central Australia is mostly desert. This area, known as the Outback, is extremely dry and has very high daytime temperatures. The southern and eastern coastal regions have a temperate climate with warm summers and mild winters.

#### New Zealand

New Zealand's climate is generally mild. The North Island has a subtropical climate with warm, humid weather. The South Island has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons. The Southern Alps receive heavy snowfall in winter.

### Plants and Animals

Australia and New Zealand are home to many unique plants and animals. Many of these species are endemic, which means they are found nowhere else on Earth.

#### Australia

Australia's isolation has allowed unusual plants and animals to develop. For example, most of Australia's mammals are marsupials, which carry their young in pouches. These include kangaroos, koalas, and wombats. Australia is also home to the platypus and echidna, which are monotremes—mammals that lay eggs.

Australia's plant life is also distinctive. Eucalyptus trees, with their distinctive smell and oil, are native to Australia. The country is also known for its acacia trees, called wattles.

#### New Zealand

New Zealand's isolation has also led to unique wildlife. Before humans arrived, the only mammals in New Zealand were bats. Instead, birds dominated the landscape. Many of these birds became flightless because they had no natural predators. The most famous of these is the kiwi, which has become a symbol of New Zealand.

New Zealand's plant life includes ancient forests of kauri trees, which can live for more than 1,000 years. Ferns are also common, and the silver fern is another national symbol.

### Natural Resources

Both Australia and New Zealand are rich in natural resources, which have helped their economies develop.

#### Australia

Australia has abundant mineral resources, including iron ore, gold, diamonds, and bauxite (used to make aluminum). It is one of the world's leading producers of coal and uranium. Australia also has large reserves of natural gas.

Agriculture is another important resource. Australia is a major producer of wool, wheat, and beef. The country's vast grasslands provide excellent grazing for sheep and cattle.

#### New Zealand

New Zealand's economy relies heavily on agriculture. The country's fertile soil and favorable climate support dairy farming, sheep raising, and fruit growing. New Zealand is one of the world's largest exporters of dairy products and lamb.

Forestry is also important, with large plantations of pine trees. The country has some mineral resources, including gold, silver, and coal, but these are less significant than in Australia.

## History and Culture

The histories of Australia and New Zealand share many similarities. Both were inhabited by native peoples before European settlement, and both were colonized by the British.

### Native Peoples

The original inhabitants of Australia and New Zealand developed rich cultures that continue to influence the region today.

#### Australia

The Aborigines are the original inhabitants of Australia. They arrived at least 50,000 years ago, making them one of the world's oldest continuous cultures. Traditionally, the Aborigines were hunter-gatherers who moved seasonally to find food. They developed a deep spiritual connection to the land, which they express through art, music, and storytelling. Their belief system, known as the Dreamtime, explains how ancestral spirits created the world and continue to influence it.

European settlement had a devastating impact on Aboriginal populations. Disease, violence, and displacement reduced their numbers dramatically. Today, Aborigines make up about 3 percent of Australia's population. Many live in remote communities, while others have moved to cities. Aboriginal culture has experienced a revival in recent decades, with growing recognition of their art, music, and land rights.

#### New Zealand

The Maori are the indigenous people of New Zealand. They arrived from Polynesia about 1,000 years ago. The Maori developed a complex society based on tribal groups. They were skilled farmers, fishers, and warriors. Their culture is known for its intricate wood carvings, facial tattoos (called moko), and powerful war dances (haka).

When Europeans arrived, the Maori population declined due to disease and warfare. However, the Maori were more successful than the Aborigines in maintaining their rights. In 1840, Maori chiefs and British representatives signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which recognized Maori ownership of their lands. Although the treaty was often ignored, it has provided a basis for modern Maori land claims. Today, Maori make up about 15 percent of New Zealand's population and their culture is an integral part of national identity.

### European Settlement

British colonization transformed Australia and New Zealand into modern nations with strong ties to Europe.

#### Australia

In 1770, British explorer James Cook claimed Australia for Great Britain. The first European settlement was established in 1788 at Sydney Cove. Initially, Australia served as a penal colony—a place where Britain sent its criminals. Between 1788 and 1868, about 160,000 convicts were transported to Australia.

Free settlers began arriving in the early 1800s, attracted by the opportunity to farm and raise sheep. The discovery of gold in the 1850s brought a rush of immigrants. By 1901, Australia's six colonies had united to form the Commonwealth of Australia, an independent nation within the British Empire.

#### New Zealand

European settlement of New Zealand began in the early 1800s with whalers, sealers, and missionaries. Organized British colonization started in the 1840s. Unlike Australia, New Zealand was never a penal colony. Most settlers were free immigrants seeking a better life.

In 1893, New Zealand became the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote. In 1907, it became a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. Full independence came gradually over the 20th century.

## Australia and New Zealand Today

Today, Australia and New Zealand are modern, prosperous nations with high standards of living. Both countries have diverse populations, strong economies, and democratic governments.

### Government and Economy

Australia and New Zealand have similar political systems based on the British parliamentary model. Both are constitutional monarchies, with the British monarch as head of state represented by a governor-general. Both have elected parliaments that make laws and prime ministers who lead the government.

Economically, both countries have moved from primarily agricultural economies to diverse, service-based economies. Australia's economy is larger and more diverse, with strong mining, manufacturing, and service sectors. New Zealand's economy relies more heavily on agriculture, tourism, and film production.

Both countries have extensive trade relationships with Asia, particularly China and Japan. They also maintain strong economic ties with the United States and Europe.

### People and Society

Australia and New Zealand are multicultural societies shaped by immigration. In Australia, waves of immigrants have arrived from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In New Zealand, immigrants have come from Pacific Island nations, Asia, and Europe.

Most Australians and New Zealanders live in urban areas. About 90 percent of Australia's population lives in large cities along the coasts. Some people are concerned that overpopulation of coastal regions will threaten species preservation and damage the natural environment. Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities, are home to just over 8.5 million people. Rural areas like the Outback, on the other hand, comprise only about 10 percent of the population. In New Zealand, a majority of the population lives on the North Island. There, large cities like Auckland are common.

## Summary and Preview
Despite their geographical differences, Australia and New Zealand have much in common. The two countries share a similar history, culture, and economy. In the next lesson you will learn about another region—the Pacific Islands.
