# Lesson 2: The Pacific Islands

## If YOU lived there...
You live on a small island in the South Pacific. For many years, the people on your island have made their living by fishing. Now, however, a European company has expressed interest in building an airport and a luxury hotel on your island. It hopes that tourists will be drawn by the island's dazzling beaches and tropical climate. The company's leaders want your permission before they build.

**Will you give them permission? Why or why not?**

## Physical Geography

The Pacific Ocean covers more than one-third of Earth's surface. Scattered throughout this ocean are thousands of islands with similar physical features, climates, and resources.

### Island Regions

We divide the Pacific Islands into three regions—Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia—based on their culture and geography. Micronesia, which means "tiny islands," is located just east of the Philippines. Some 2,000 small islands make up this region. South of Micronesia is Melanesia, which stretches from New Guinea in the west to Fiji in the east. Melanesia is the most heavily populated Pacific Island region. The largest region is Polynesia, which means "many islands." Among Polynesia's many islands are Tonga, Samoa, and the Hawaiian Islands.

### Physical Features

The Pacific Islands differ greatly. Some islands, like New Guinea (GI-nee), cover thousands of square miles. Other islands are tiny. For example, Nauru covers only 8 square miles (21 square km).

Geographers classify the islands of the Pacific as either high islands or low islands. High islands tend to be mountainous and rocky. Most high islands are volcanic islands. They were formed when volcanic mountains grew from the ocean floor and reached the surface. The islands of Tahiti and Hawaii in Polynesia are examples of high islands.

Low islands are generally flat and close to sea level. Most low islands are coral islands. They were formed when coral reefs grew on top of sunken volcanoes. Some coral islands are atolls. An atoll is a ring-shaped coral island that surrounds a lagoon. The Marshall Islands in Micronesia include many atolls.

### Climate

The Pacific Islands have tropical climates. Temperatures are warm year-round, with little seasonal variation. Most islands receive abundant rainfall, which supports lush vegetation. However, rainfall patterns can vary widely, even on a single island. For example, on some high islands, one side may receive heavy rainfall while the other side remains relatively dry.

The Pacific Islands are vulnerable to tropical storms, including typhoons (called hurricanes in the eastern Pacific). These powerful storms can cause significant damage to the islands' infrastructure and ecosystems.

### Natural Resources

The Pacific Islands have limited natural resources. The most important resources are the ocean and its marine life. Fish and other seafood provide food for islanders and are also exported. Coconut palms grow on many islands and provide food, building materials, and products for export, such as coconut oil.

Some islands have mineral resources. For example, New Caledonia has large deposits of nickel, and Nauru once had valuable phosphate deposits (now largely depleted). Forests on the larger islands provide timber and other forest products.

The islands' beautiful beaches, clear waters, and tropical climate are also valuable resources, attracting tourists from around the world.

## History and Culture

The Pacific Islands have a rich cultural heritage shaped by their isolation and later contact with the Western world.

### Early Settlement

The Pacific Islands were settled by seafaring peoples who made remarkable ocean voyages in canoes. These voyages began thousands of years ago and continued until about 1000 CE.

The first settlers came from Southeast Asia. They gradually spread eastward across the Pacific, developing distinct cultures on different islands. These early settlers brought plants and animals with them, including pigs, chickens, and crops like taro and breadfruit.

The islanders developed sophisticated navigation techniques, using the stars, ocean currents, and other natural signs to find their way across vast stretches of open ocean. They also developed complex social structures, religious beliefs, and artistic traditions.

### European Contact

European explorers began visiting the Pacific Islands in the 1500s. Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to cross the Pacific Ocean in 1521. Later explorers included the Dutch, British, and French.

In the late 1700s, British explorer James Cook made three voyages to the Pacific, mapping many islands and making detailed observations of the people and their cultures. European contact brought significant changes to the islands, including new technologies, crops, and animals, as well as diseases that devastated many island populations.

During the 1800s and early 1900s, European powers colonized most of the Pacific Islands. Britain, France, Germany, and the United States all claimed islands as colonies or territories. A territory is a region that is controlled by a distant country and lacks full political independence. Colonial rule disrupted traditional ways of life and introduced Western education, religion, and economic systems.

### World War II and Independence

World War II had a major impact on the Pacific Islands. Many islands became battlegrounds as Japan and the Allied powers fought for control of the Pacific. After the war, a movement for independence began across the region.

Since the 1960s, many Pacific Island nations have gained independence. Others remain territories of larger countries. For example, French Polynesia and New Caledonia are still French territories, while American Samoa is a territory of the United States.

### Culture

Despite centuries of outside influence, traditional culture remains important throughout the Pacific Islands. Many islanders continue to practice traditional customs, speak indigenous languages, and maintain strong connections to their cultural heritage.

Family and community are central to Pacific Island cultures. Extended families often live together or near each other, and important decisions are made collectively. Traditional arts, such as wood carving, weaving, and tattooing, remain important cultural expressions.

Music and dance are integral parts of island cultures. Traditional dances often tell stories or commemorate important events. In Hawaii, the hula dance preserves ancient legends and history. In Samoa, the siva dance expresses cultural identity and community values.

Religion is also important in Pacific Island cultures. Christianity, introduced by missionaries in the 1800s, is now the dominant religion in most islands. However, many islanders blend Christian beliefs with traditional spiritual practices.

## The Pacific Islands Today

Today, the Pacific Islands face both opportunities and challenges as they navigate the modern world while preserving their unique cultures and environments.

### Government and Economy

The Pacific Islands include independent nations, self-governing territories, and territories controlled by other countries. Independent nations, such as Fiji and Samoa, have their own governments and make their own laws. Self-governing territories, like the Cook Islands, control their internal affairs but rely on larger countries for defense and foreign relations. Other islands, like Guam and French Polynesia, remain territories of larger countries.

The economies of the Pacific Islands are generally small and face significant challenges. Limited resources, small populations, and geographic isolation make economic development difficult. Many islands rely heavily on foreign aid, particularly from Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and former colonial powers.

Tourism is a major industry on many islands. Visitors are attracted by beautiful beaches, clear waters, and unique cultures. However, tourism can also put pressure on fragile environments and traditional ways of life.

Agriculture and fishing are important economic activities. Coconut products, sugar, tropical fruits, and fish are major exports. Some islands have developed manufacturing industries, particularly clothing and handicrafts.

Remittances—money sent home by islanders working abroad—are also an important source of income for many families and communities.

### Environmental Challenges

The Pacific Islands face significant environmental challenges. Pollution from plastic waste, industrial activities, and sewage threatens marine ecosystems, including coral reefs. Overfishing has depleted fish stocks in some areas, affecting both the environment and local economies.

Deforestation is a problem on some of the larger islands, where forests are cleared for agriculture, logging, and development. This can lead to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and reduced water quality.

Climate change poses perhaps the greatest threat to the Pacific Islands. Rising sea levels could eventually make some low-lying islands uninhabitable. More frequent and intense storms, changing rainfall patterns, and ocean acidification also threaten island environments and communities.

These environmental problems for people in the region. Global warming also concerns Pacific Islanders. Some researchers believe that rising temperatures may cause polar ice to melt. The rise in ocean levels would threaten low-lying Pacific islands.

## Summary and Preview
The Pacific Islands are one of the most isolated regions in the world. As a result, unique cultures and challenges exist in the region. In the next lesson you will learn about another isolated part of the globe—Antarctica.
