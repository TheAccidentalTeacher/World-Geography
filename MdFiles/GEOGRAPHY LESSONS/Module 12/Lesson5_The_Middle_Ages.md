## The Christian Church and Society

When historians talk about the past, they often divide it into three long periods. The first period is the ancient world, the time of the world's earliest civilizations, such as Egypt, China, Greece, and Rome. The last period historians call the modern world, the world since about 1500. Since that time, new ideas and contacts between civilizations changed the world completely.

What happened between ancient and modern times? We call this period, which lasted from about 500 until about 1500, the Middle Ages. We also call it the medieval (mee-DEE-vuhl) period. The word medieval comes from two Latin words that mean "middle age." It was a time of great changes in Europe, many of them inspired by the Christian Church.

### The Importance of the Church

When the Roman Empire fell apart in the late 400s, the people of Europe were left without a single dominant government to unite them. In the absence of strong leaders, Europe broke into many small kingdoms. Each of these kingdoms had its own laws, customs, and language. Europe was no longer the same place it had been under the Romans.

One factor, however, continued to tie the people of Europe together—religion. Nearly everyone in Europe was Christian, and so most Europeans felt tied together by their beliefs. Over time, the number of Christians in Europe increased. People came to feel more and more like part of a single religious community.

The Christian Church became the most powerful institution in medieval Europe. The Church influenced nearly every aspect of people's lives. Church officials taught people how to worship and how to behave. They also provided education and helped the poor and sick.

The leader of the Church was the pope, who lived in Rome. The pope had great influence over the kings and queens of Europe. In fact, the pope claimed that his authority came directly from God. As a result, he claimed to have authority over all Christians, including kings and queens.

## The Crusades

As the Christian Church gained influence in Europe, some Christians began to worry about the safety of the Holy Land, the area in Southwest Asia where Jesus had lived. The Holy Land had been under Muslim control for centuries, but most Christians and Muslims had lived together peacefully. In the 1000s, however, a group of Muslims began to threaten Christian pilgrims visiting the Holy Land.

In 1095, the Byzantine emperor asked Pope Urban II of the Roman Catholic Church for help. The pope agreed to the emperor's request and called on Christians throughout Europe to join a holy war, or Crusade, to regain the Holy Land from the Muslims.

Between 1096 and 1291, Europeans launched a series of Crusades to the Holy Land. At first, the Crusaders were successful. They captured Jerusalem and created four small Christian states in the Holy Land. However, Muslims eventually recaptured these states. By 1291, Muslims had driven the Crusaders out of the Holy Land and the Crusades had ended.

### Crusades Change Europe

Although the Crusades failed, they changed Europe in many ways. For example, as Crusaders traveled to the Holy Land, they saw many new products and goods. When they returned to Europe, they wanted these products for themselves. As a result, trade between Europe and Asia increased dramatically.

The Crusades also led to changes in the way Europeans thought about themselves and others. Crusaders who returned to Europe brought with them new knowledge of the world beyond Europe. This knowledge helped spark an interest in learning and education.

## The Feudal System

When Rome fell, western Europe lost its central government. Without this government, people had no protection from invaders. As a result, they turned to local rulers for protection. These local rulers, in turn, relied on lesser nobles to help them govern their lands and fight their enemies. This system of rule, in which people pledged loyalty to a lord in return for protection, is called the feudal system.

### Feudal Relationships

Under the feudal system, the most powerful person was the king. The king granted fiefs, or pieces of land, to nobles called lords. In return, these lords promised to fight for the king. The lords, in turn, granted smaller fiefs to lesser nobles called knights. Knights promised to fight for their lords.

At the bottom of the feudal system were peasants, who made up the vast majority of the population. Most peasants were serfs, people who were tied to the land they worked. Serfs were not slaves—they could not be bought and sold—but they could not leave the land without their lord's permission.

### Manors

Most people in medieval Europe lived on manors, or large estates owned by lords. Each manor included a manor house where the lord lived, a village where the peasants lived, and surrounding farmland. The manor was largely self-sufficient, producing most of what its residents needed.

Life on a manor was difficult, especially for peasants. They worked long hours in the fields and had few comforts. However, the manor system provided people with security and stability in a dangerous world.

## Changes in Medieval Society

After about 1000, medieval society began to change in significant ways. These changes affected nearly every aspect of life in Europe.

### Political Changes in England

One of the countries most affected by these changes was England. In 1066, William, the Duke of Normandy in France, invaded England and became its king. William and later kings strengthened the power of the English monarchy.

However, the power of English kings was not absolute. In 1215, a group of nobles forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, a document that limited the king's power. The Magna Carta established the principle that the king had to obey the law, just like everyone else.

Later, English kings established a parliament, or lawmaking body, that included representatives from different parts of English society. Over time, Parliament gained more power, and the power of the king decreased.

### The Growth of Towns and Trade

Another important change in medieval Europe was the growth of towns and trade. As trade increased, especially after the Crusades, towns began to grow. These towns became centers of manufacturing and commerce.

Town residents, called burghers or bourgeoisie, were not part of the feudal system. They were free people who could own property and businesses. Over time, many towns gained the right to govern themselves.

### Cultural and Intellectual Changes

The Middle Ages also saw significant cultural and intellectual changes. Universities were established in cities across Europe, and learning flourished. Gothic architecture, characterized by pointed arches, flying buttresses, and large stained glass windows, transformed the appearance of churches and cathedrals.

The late Middle Ages also saw the development of vernacular literature, or literature written in everyday languages rather than Latin. Writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer in England and Dante Alighieri in Italy wrote important works in their native languages.

### The Rise of Nation-States

Perhaps the most significant change in the late Middle Ages was the rise of nation-states, or countries with centralized governments ruling over unified territories. France, England, and Spain all began to develop as nation-states during this period.

The rise of nation-states marked the beginning of the end of the feudal system. As kings consolidated their power, the importance of feudal lords decreased. By the end of the Middle Ages, the political landscape of Europe had been transformed.

## Conclusion

The Middle Ages was a period of significant change in Europe. The Christian Church became the dominant institution, influencing nearly every aspect of life. The feudal system provided political and economic structure in a time of decentralized authority. And the period after 1000 saw important changes in politics, economics, and culture that would help lay the groundwork for the modern world.
