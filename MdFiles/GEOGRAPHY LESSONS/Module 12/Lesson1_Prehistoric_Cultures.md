# Lesson 1: Prehistoric Cultures

## The Big Idea
Prehistoric people adapted to their environment and developed agriculture.

## Main Ideas
- Scientists study the remains of early humans to learn about prehistory.
- Early humans moved out of Africa and migrated all over the world.
- People adapted to new environments by making clothing and new types of tools.
- The first farmers learned to grow plants and raise animals in the New Stone Age.
- Farming changed societies and the way people lived.

## Prehistoric Humans

Although humans have lived on Earth for more than a million years, writing was not invented until about five thousand years ago. Historians call the time before there was writing prehistory. To study prehistory, historians rely on the work of archaeologists and anthropologists. Historic time periods, on the other hand, are those for which information has been recorded with letters, words, or numbers.

### Studying Prehistory

Archaeologists study the remains of early human settlements. They look for tools, weapons, pottery, and other objects that early humans made. They also look for the remains of buildings and other structures. By studying these artifacts, archaeologists can learn about how early humans lived.

Anthropologists study human cultures and how they develop. They look at how people in different cultures live, what they believe, and how they interact with each other. By studying modern hunter-gatherer societies, anthropologists can make educated guesses about how prehistoric people lived.

Scientists also study the remains of early humans themselves. By examining bones and other remains, they can learn about the physical characteristics of early humans, what they ate, and what diseases they had. They can also use DNA analysis to trace the relationships between different groups of early humans.

### Early Human Species

Scientists believe that the first human ancestors appeared in Africa about 6 million years ago. These early hominids, or human-like species, walked upright but had small brains and were more like apes than modern humans.

Over time, several different species of hominids evolved. Some of the most important include:

- **Australopithecus**: Lived in Africa from about 4 million to 2 million years ago. They walked upright but had small brains.

- **Homo habilis**: Lived in Africa from about 2.4 million to 1.5 million years ago. They had larger brains than Australopithecus and made simple stone tools.

- **Homo erectus**: Lived from about 1.9 million to 143,000 years ago. They had larger brains than Homo habilis and made more sophisticated tools. They were the first hominids to migrate out of Africa.

- **Homo neanderthalensis**: Lived in Europe and parts of Asia from about 400,000 to 40,000 years ago. They had large brains, made sophisticated tools, and buried their dead.

- **Homo sapiens**: Our own species, which evolved in Africa about 300,000 years ago. Modern humans have large brains, complex language, and the ability to create and use sophisticated tools and technology.

## Human Migration

Early humans moved out of Africa and migrated all over the world. This process took place over hundreds of thousands of years.

### Out of Africa

The first human species to leave Africa was Homo erectus, which migrated into Asia and Europe beginning about 1.8 million years ago. Remains of Homo erectus have been found in China, Indonesia, and other parts of Asia.

Homo sapiens, our own species, evolved in Africa about 300,000 years ago. Beginning about 70,000 years ago, groups of Homo sapiens began to migrate out of Africa. They spread first into the Middle East, then into Asia, Europe, Australia, and eventually the Americas.

As they migrated, early humans had to adapt to new environments. They encountered different climates, landscapes, plants, and animals. They also encountered other human species, such as the Neanderthals in Europe and the Denisovans in Asia. There is evidence that Homo sapiens interbred with these other human species to some extent.

### Peopling of the Americas

The Americas were the last continents to be settled by humans. Scientists believe that the first humans arrived in North America from Asia during the last Ice Age, between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. At that time, sea levels were lower because so much water was frozen in glaciers. This created a land bridge, called Beringia, between Siberia and Alaska.

The first Americans crossed this land bridge and gradually spread throughout North and South America. By about 12,000 years ago, humans had reached the southern tip of South America.

## Adaptation and Innovation

As early humans migrated to new environments, they had to adapt to survive. They developed new tools, clothing, and shelters suited to their new surroundings.

### Stone Age Tools

The earliest human tools were simple stone implements used for cutting and scraping. Over time, humans developed more sophisticated tools for specific purposes. The period when humans used stone tools is called the Stone Age, which is divided into three periods:

1. **Paleolithic (Old Stone Age)**: From the first use of stone tools about 2.6 million years ago to about 10,000 BCE. During this period, humans were primarily hunter-gatherers who used simple stone tools.

2. **Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age)**: A transitional period from about 10,000 to 8,000 BCE in Europe. During this time, humans began to develop more specialized tools.

3. **Neolithic (New Stone Age)**: From about 8,000 to 3,000 BCE. This period saw the development of agriculture and more sophisticated stone tools.

During the Paleolithic period, humans made tools by striking one stone against another to create a sharp edge. This technique is called knapping. Later, they learned to make more refined tools by carefully removing small flakes from a stone core.

### Clothing and Shelter

As humans moved into colder regions, they had to develop ways to stay warm. They made clothing from animal skins and furs. They also learned to use plant fibers to make thread and cord, which they could use to sew skins together or to make nets for fishing.

Early humans lived in a variety of shelters, depending on their environment and the available materials. In some places, they lived in caves or rock shelters. In others, they built simple huts using branches, animal skins, or other materials. In cold regions, they sometimes built shelters using mammoth bones and tusks.

### Fire and Cooking

One of the most important innovations of early humans was the control of fire. Fire provided warmth, light, and protection from predators. It also allowed humans to cook food, which made it easier to digest and killed harmful bacteria.

Scientists believe that Homo erectus was the first human species to control fire, perhaps as early as 1.5 million years ago. By the time Homo sapiens evolved, the use of fire was well established.

### Art and Ritual

Some of the most remarkable evidence of prehistoric human culture comes from cave paintings and other forms of art. The oldest known cave paintings, found in Indonesia, date back about 45,000 years. In Europe, cave paintings dating from about 30,000 to 10,000 years ago have been found in France, Spain, and other countries.

These paintings often depict animals that prehistoric humans hunted, such as bison, horses, and deer. Some also show human figures or abstract symbols. Scientists believe that these paintings may have had religious or ceremonial significance.

Prehistoric humans also created sculptures and other forms of art. The Venus figurines, small statues of women with exaggerated sexual features, are among the oldest known sculptures. They date from about 35,000 to 11,000 years ago and have been found across Europe and Asia.

## The Agricultural Revolution

One of the most significant changes in human history was the transition from hunting and gathering to farming. This change, often called the Agricultural Revolution or the Neolithic Revolution, began about 12,000 years ago.

### The First Farmers

The earliest evidence of farming comes from the Middle East, in an area called the Fertile Crescent. This region, which includes parts of modern-day Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan, had a favorable climate and fertile soil for agriculture.

Around 10,000 BCE, people in this region began to cultivate wild grains such as wheat and barley. They also domesticated animals such as sheep, goats, and pigs. Over time, they selected and bred plants and animals with desirable traits, gradually changing them from their wild forms.

Agriculture developed independently in several other parts of the world as well:

- In China, rice and millet were domesticated around 7000 BCE.
- In Mesoamerica (Mexico and Central America), maize (corn) was domesticated around 7000 BCE.
- In the Andes region of South America, potatoes and quinoa were domesticated around 5000 BCE.
- In Africa, sorghum and millet were domesticated around 4000 BCE.

### Advantages of Agriculture

Farming offered several advantages over hunting and gathering:

1. **Reliable Food Supply**: Farmers could produce more food in a smaller area than hunter-gatherers could obtain by foraging. This made food supplies more reliable and allowed populations to grow.

2. **Sedentary Lifestyle**: Farmers could live in one place year-round, rather than having to move to follow game or seasonal plant foods. This allowed them to build more permanent homes and accumulate more possessions.

3. **Specialization**: With a surplus of food, not everyone needed to be involved in food production. Some people could specialize in other activities, such as making tools, building structures, or creating art.

### Challenges of Agriculture

Despite its advantages, agriculture also presented challenges:

1. **Hard Work**: Farming required more labor than hunting and gathering. Farmers had to clear land, plant seeds, tend crops, harvest, and store food.

2. **Dependence on Weather**: Farmers were vulnerable to droughts, floods, and other weather events that could destroy their crops.

3. **Health Problems**: The shift to a diet based on a few staple crops often led to nutritional deficiencies. Living in permanent settlements with domesticated animals also increased the risk of infectious diseases.

4. **Social Inequality**: The ability to accumulate surplus food and other goods led to the development of social hierarchies and inequality.

## Changes in Society

The Agricultural Revolution led to profound changes in human society. As people settled in permanent villages and began to produce surplus food, new social structures and institutions emerged.

### Permanent Settlements

The earliest farming villages were small communities of a few dozen to a few hundred people. These villages consisted of simple houses made of mud brick, stone, or other local materials. Over time, some villages grew into larger settlements, and eventually into cities.

One of the oldest known settlements is Jericho, located in the West Bank. It was first settled around 9000 BCE and had a population of about 2,000 people by 7000 BCE. Another ancient settlement is Çatalhöyük in Turkey, which was inhabited from about 7500 to 5700 BCE and may have had a population of up to 10,000 people.

### Specialization and Trade

With a surplus of food, not everyone needed to be involved in farming. Some people could specialize in other activities, such as making pottery, weaving textiles, or crafting tools. This specialization led to the development of trade, as people exchanged goods and services.

Trade networks gradually expanded, connecting distant communities. Valuable materials such as obsidian (volcanic glass used for making sharp tools), shells, and metals were traded over long distances.

### Social Hierarchy

As societies became more complex, social hierarchies emerged. Some individuals or families accumulated more wealth and power than others. This led to the development of social classes, with elites who controlled resources and made decisions for the community.

Evidence of social hierarchy can be seen in burial practices. In some prehistoric societies, certain individuals were buried with valuable goods, suggesting that they had higher status than others.

### Religion and Ritual

Agriculture also influenced religious beliefs and practices. Many early farming societies developed religions centered around fertility and the cycles of nature. They built temples and other religious structures, and they performed rituals to ensure good harvests.

One of the most famous prehistoric religious sites is Stonehenge in England. Built between about 3000 and 1500 BCE, it consists of large standing stones arranged in a circle. The purpose of Stonehenge is not fully understood, but it may have been used for religious ceremonies or astronomical observations.

## Conclusion

The prehistoric period saw the evolution of humans from early hominids to modern Homo sapiens. As humans migrated out of Africa and spread around the world, they adapted to diverse environments by developing new tools, clothing, and shelters. They also created art and engaged in religious or ritual practices.

The development of agriculture around 12,000 years ago marked a major turning point in human history. Farming allowed people to settle in permanent communities, produce surplus food, and develop specialized occupations. It also led to the emergence of social hierarchies, trade networks, and new religious practices.

These developments laid the foundation for the rise of the first civilizations, which would emerge in the river valleys of the Middle East, Egypt, India, and China. The innovations and adaptations of prehistoric humans continue to influence our world today, from the crops we grow to the tools we use.
