## Emperors Rule from Constantinople

In the late 200s the emperor Diocletian divided the Roman Empire into two parts—east and west—hoping to make the empire easier to rule. In spite of his efforts, years of invasions and economic instability eventually led to the fall of the western Roman Empire in 476.

Even before the fall of Rome, power had begun to shift to the richer, more stable east. The Roman Empire continued in the east, and the people of the eastern Roman Empire considered themselves Romans. The culture, however, was also very different from that of Rome itself.

The center of the eastern Roman Empire was the city of Constantinople. Constantinople was built on the site of an ancient Greek trading city called Byzantium (buh-ZAN-tee-uhm). It lay on a peninsula near both the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, which protected the city from attack and let the city control trade between Europe and Asia. This protection allowed Constantinople to continue Rome's legacy, and the city became a magnificent city filled with great buildings, palaces, and churches.

After the western part of the empire fell, the eastern part became known as the Byzantine Empire, named for Byzantium. The Byzantine Empire would last for nearly 1,000 years after the fall of Rome.

### Justinian's Rule

One of the greatest Byzantine emperors was Justinian (juh-STIN-ee-uhn), who ruled from 527 to 565. Justinian had one primary goal as emperor—to reunite the Roman Empire under his rule. To accomplish this goal, he needed to reconquer the lands of the western empire.

Justinian's armies won back parts of Italy, Spain, and North Africa. However, these victories did not last long. Soon after Justinian died, many of the lands he had conquered were taken by Germanic peoples.

Although Justinian failed to reunite the empire, he did make other lasting contributions. For example, he collected all of Rome's laws into a single legal code called the Justinian Code. This code became the basis for many legal systems in Europe.

## Byzantine Society

Byzantine society was different from society in the western Roman Empire in several ways. One way it was different was the Byzantines' interaction with other groups. This interaction came about because Constantinople was located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. People from many lands came to Constantinople to trade. Over time, Byzantine society began to reflect these various cultural influences.

The structure of Byzantine society was also different. Byzantine emperors had more power than western emperors did. In the west, the emperor's power was limited to political power. Popes and other bishops were the leaders of the church. In the Byzantine Empire, however, the emperor was considered both the political and the religious ruler. The Byzantines thought the emperor had been chosen by God to lead both the empire and the church.

## Byzantine Christianity

Christianity was central to the Byzantines' lives, just as it was to the lives of people in western Europe. However, the Byzantines began to practice Christianity differently. For example, eastern priests could get married, while priests in the west could not. Also, eastern church services were conducted in Greek, the language of the eastern empire, while western services used Latin.

Over time, the differences between eastern and western Christianity grew. In 1054 the eastern church broke away from the Roman Catholic Church. The eastern church became known as the Orthodox Church and developed Orthodox Christianity. As a result, eastern and western Europe were divided not only politically but religiously as well.

## Byzantine Achievements

The Byzantines made many achievements in art and learning. Byzantine artists created beautiful mosaics, pictures made from many pieces of colored glass or stone. Byzantine architects designed great buildings, including the magnificent church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople.

Byzantine scholars preserved much knowledge from ancient Greece and Rome. They copied and protected thousands of ancient works that might otherwise have been lost. Later, they shared these works with people in western Europe, helping to spread ancient knowledge and ideas.

## Conclusion

The Byzantine Empire preserved and extended the legacy of Rome for nearly 1,000 years after the fall of the western Roman Empire. Through its political systems, religious developments, and cultural achievements, the Byzantine Empire made significant contributions to world history and served as a bridge between ancient and medieval times.
