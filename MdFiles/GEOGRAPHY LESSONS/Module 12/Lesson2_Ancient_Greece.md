## Early Greek Culture

Suppose you and some friends wanted to go to the movies, but you could not decide which movie to see. Some of you might want to see the latest action thriller, while others are more in the mood for a comedy. How could you decide which movie you would go to see? One way to decide would be to take a vote. Whichever movie got more votes would be the one you saw.

Did you know that by voting you would be taking part in a process invented some 2,500 years ago? It is true. One of the greatest contributions of the ancient Greeks to the world was the idea of democracy, or rule by the people. In a democracy, citizens vote to make decisions or to choose people to make decisions for them.

### Geography of Greece

The geography of Greece played a significant role in shaping Greek civilization. Greece is a mountainous peninsula that extends into the Mediterranean Sea. It has a long, irregular coastline with many islands scattered throughout the Aegean and Ionian seas.

The mountains that cover much of Greece made travel and communication between different regions difficult. As a result, the ancient Greeks developed separate, independent communities rather than a single unified state. The mountains also limited the amount of farmland available, which led to food shortages and encouraged the Greeks to establish colonies elsewhere.

The sea, on the other hand, provided opportunities for trade, travel, and colonization. The Greeks became skilled sailors and established colonies and trading posts throughout the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions. The sea also provided a source of food and served as a barrier against invasion.

### The Rise of City-States

The ancient Greeks organized themselves into independent city-states, or poleis (singular: polis). A city-state consisted of a city or town and its surrounding countryside. Each city-state had its own government, laws, army, and currency. By 750 BCE, there were hundreds of Greek city-states.

Despite their independence, the Greek city-states shared a common language, religion, and culture. They saw themselves as part of a larger Greek world, or Hellas, and referred to themselves as Hellenes. They distinguished themselves from non-Greeks, whom they called barbarians (from the Greek word "barbaros," meaning "one who babbles" or speaks a foreign language).

The city-states often competed with each other for resources and power, leading to frequent conflicts. However, they also cooperated in religious festivals and athletic competitions, such as the Olympic Games, which began in 776 BCE.

### Greek Colonization

Beginning around 750 BCE, the Greeks established colonies throughout the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions. Several factors drove this colonization:

1. **Population Growth**: As the population of Greece increased, there was not enough farmland to support everyone.

2. **Food Shortages**: The mountainous terrain of Greece limited agricultural production, leading to food shortages.

3. **Political Conflicts**: Some colonies were founded by people who had been exiled from their home city-states due to political conflicts.

4. **Trade Opportunities**: Colonies were established to facilitate trade with other regions.

Greek colonies were independent city-states, not territories controlled by their mother cities. However, they maintained cultural and religious ties with their mother cities and with the broader Greek world.

By 550 BCE, Greek colonies could be found from Spain in the west to the Black Sea in the east. This spread of Greek settlement helped to disseminate Greek culture, language, and ideas throughout the Mediterranean world.

### Greek Religion and Mythology

Religion played a central role in ancient Greek life. The Greeks were polytheistic, meaning they believed in many gods and goddesses. The twelve main gods and goddesses, known as the Olympians, were believed to live on Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece.

Each deity had specific powers and responsibilities. For example:

- **Zeus**: King of the gods, god of the sky and thunder
- **Hera**: Queen of the gods, goddess of marriage and childbirth
- **Poseidon**: God of the sea and earthquakes
- **Athena**: Goddess of wisdom, warfare, and crafts
- **Apollo**: God of music, prophecy, and healing
- **Artemis**: Goddess of the hunt and the moon
- **Aphrodite**: Goddess of love and beauty
- **Ares**: God of war
- **Hephaestus**: God of fire and metalworking
- **Hermes**: Messenger of the gods, god of commerce and thieves
- **Demeter**: Goddess of agriculture and the harvest
- **Dionysus**: God of wine and festivity

The Greeks built temples to honor their gods and goddesses and made offerings and sacrifices to gain their favor. They also consulted oracles, such as the famous Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, to seek guidance from the gods.

Greek mythology, the collection of stories about the gods, goddesses, heroes, and monsters, was an important part of Greek culture. These myths explained natural phenomena, provided moral lessons, and entertained. They were passed down orally before being written down by poets such as Homer and Hesiod.

## The Golden Age of Greece

The period from about 480 to 323 BCE is often called the golden age of Greece, a time when Greek culture, particularly in Athens, reached its peak. This period saw remarkable achievements in government, philosophy, literature, art, and architecture.

### Athens and Democracy

Athens, located in the region of Attica, became the most powerful and influential Greek city-state during the golden age. Under the leadership of Pericles (495-429 BCE), Athens developed the world's first democratic government.

In Athenian democracy, all citizens had the right to participate directly in government. They could attend the Assembly, where they debated and voted on laws and policies. They could also serve on the Council of 500, which prepared business for the Assembly, and on juries, which decided court cases.

However, citizenship in Athens was limited to free adult men who were born to Athenian parents. Women, slaves, and foreigners, who made up the majority of the population, were excluded from political participation.

Despite these limitations, Athenian democracy was a revolutionary concept. It established the principle that ordinary citizens, not just the wealthy or well-born, should have a say in how they are governed.

### Sparta: A Contrasting Society

While Athens was developing democracy, its rival Sparta was following a very different path. Sparta was a militaristic society focused on producing strong soldiers.

Spartan society was divided into three classes:

1. **Spartans**: Full citizens who were trained from childhood to be soldiers.

2. **Perioeci**: Free non-citizens who worked as craftsmen, traders, and farmers.

3. **Helots**: Enslaved people who worked the land owned by Spartans.

Sparta was ruled by two kings and a council of elders. There was also an assembly of citizens, but it had limited powers.

Spartan boys were taken from their homes at age 7 to begin their military training. They lived in barracks, were given minimal food and clothing, and were subjected to harsh discipline. This training continued until they were 30 years old.

Spartan women had more freedom and education than women in other Greek city-states. They were expected to be physically fit so they could bear healthy children for the state.

### The Persian Wars

The Persian Wars (499-449 BCE) were a series of conflicts between the Greek city-states and the Persian Empire, which was the largest empire in the world at that time.

The wars began when the Greek cities in Ionia (on the western coast of modern Turkey), which were under Persian rule, rebelled against the Persians. Athens sent ships to help the Ionians, which angered the Persian king Darius I.

In 490 BCE, Darius sent a fleet to punish Athens. The Persians landed at Marathon, about 26 miles from Athens. Despite being outnumbered, the Athenians defeated the Persians in the Battle of Marathon. According to legend, a messenger ran all the way from Marathon to Athens to announce the victory, which is the origin of the modern marathon race.

Ten years later, Darius's son Xerxes led a massive invasion of Greece. The Spartans, led by King Leonidas, made a heroic stand against the Persians at the Battle of Thermopylae, but were ultimately defeated. The Persians then captured and burned Athens.

However, the Greek fleet, led by the Athenians, defeated the Persian navy in the Battle of Salamis. The following year, a combined Greek army defeated the Persian land forces at the Battle of Plataea, ending the Persian threat to Greece.

The victory over the Persians was a pivotal moment in Greek history. It saved Greek independence and boosted confidence in Greek, particularly Athenian, institutions and culture.

### The Peloponnesian War

After the Persian Wars, Athens formed an alliance called the Delian League with other Greek city-states to protect against future Persian attacks. Over time, Athens turned this alliance into an empire, using the league's treasury for Athenian projects and forcing member states to follow Athenian policies.

This growing Athenian power alarmed Sparta and its allies, leading to the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BCE). This devastating conflict pitted Athens and its allies against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League.

After 27 years of warfare, Sparta finally defeated Athens with Persian help. The war weakened all the Greek city-states and ended the golden age of Greece.

### Greek Philosophy

The golden age of Greece saw the emergence of philosophy, the love of wisdom and the search for understanding through rational inquiry. The Greek philosophers sought to understand the world through reason rather than through myth or religion.

Some of the most important Greek philosophers include:

1. **Socrates (469-399 BCE)**: Known for his method of questioning, called the Socratic method, which aimed to stimulate critical thinking. Socrates was put to death by the Athenian government for "corrupting the youth" and "impiety."

2. **Plato (427-347 BCE)**: A student of Socrates who founded the Academy, one of the earliest known organized schools in Western civilization. Plato wrote dialogues featuring Socrates as the main character and explored topics such as justice, beauty, and equality.

3. **Aristotle (384-322 BCE)**: A student of Plato who later tutored Alexander the Great. Aristotle studied a wide range of subjects, including physics, biology, politics, and ethics. He founded the Lyceum, another important school in Athens.

These philosophers laid the foundation for Western philosophy and scientific thought. Their ideas about ethics, politics, metaphysics, and logic continue to influence thinkers today.

### Greek Art and Architecture

Greek art and architecture also reached their peak during the golden age. Greek artists sought to create works that were harmonious, balanced, and idealized.

Greek sculpture evolved from the stiff, formal statues of the Archaic period to the more naturalistic, idealized figures of the Classical period. Greek sculptors such as Phidias and Praxiteles created statues that celebrated the beauty of the human form.

Greek architecture is known for its elegant simplicity and mathematical precision. The most famous example is the Parthenon, a temple dedicated to Athena on the Acropolis in Athens. Built between 447 and 438 BCE, the Parthenon exemplifies the Classical Greek architectural style, with its perfect proportions and subtle refinements.

Greek theaters, such as the Theater of Dionysus in Athens, were architectural marvels that could accommodate thousands of spectators. These theaters were the venues for performances of Greek tragedies and comedies by playwrights such as Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes.

### Greek Literature

Greek literature flourished during the golden age. The period saw the development of several literary forms, including tragedy, comedy, and history.

Greek tragedy, performed at religious festivals honoring Dionysus, dealt with profound moral and ethical questions. The three great tragedians were Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Their plays, such as Aeschylus's "Oresteia," Sophocles's "Oedipus Rex," and Euripides's "Medea," are still performed today.

Greek comedy, represented by playwrights such as Aristophanes, often satirized contemporary politics and society. Aristophanes's plays, such as "Lysistrata" and "The Clouds," provide valuable insights into Athenian life and politics.

The golden age also saw the birth of history as a discipline with the works of Herodotus and Thucydides. Herodotus, often called the "Father of History," wrote about the Persian Wars in his "Histories." Thucydides, known for his objective and analytical approach, chronicled the Peloponnesian War.

## Alexander the Great and Hellenistic Culture

After the Peloponnesian War, the Greek city-states were weakened and divided. This allowed Philip II of Macedon, a kingdom to the north of Greece, to conquer most of Greece by 338 BCE. After Philip's assassination in 336 BCE, his son Alexander became king.

### Alexander's Conquests

Alexander, later known as Alexander the Great, was one of history's most successful military commanders. Tutored by Aristotle in his youth, Alexander combined intellectual brilliance with military genius and charismatic leadership.

In 334 BCE, Alexander began a series of campaigns that would create one of the largest empires of the ancient world. He first conquered the Persian Empire, defeating the Persian king Darius III in several major battles. He then continued eastward, conquering parts of Central Asia and India.

By the time of his death in 323 BCE at the age of 32, Alexander had created an empire that stretched from Greece to India. His conquests spread Greek culture throughout the Middle East and Central Asia, beginning the Hellenistic period.

### The Hellenistic World

After Alexander's death, his empire was divided among his generals, leading to the establishment of several Hellenistic kingdoms:

1. **The Ptolemaic Kingdom** in Egypt, ruled by the Ptolemy dynasty.

2. **The Seleucid Empire** in Persia, Mesopotamia, and parts of India, ruled by the Seleucid dynasty.

3. **The Kingdom of Macedon** in Greece and Macedonia, eventually ruled by the Antigonid dynasty.

4. **Several smaller kingdoms** in Asia Minor and the Middle East.

These kingdoms were characterized by a blend of Greek and local cultures, known as Hellenistic culture. Greek became the common language of government, commerce, and culture throughout the region.

### Hellenistic Culture

Hellenistic culture was a fusion of Greek and Eastern influences. It was more cosmopolitan and diverse than Classical Greek culture, reflecting the multicultural nature of the Hellenistic kingdoms.

Hellenistic cities, such as Alexandria in Egypt, became centers of learning and culture. The Library of Alexandria, founded by the Ptolemies, was the largest library in the ancient world, housing hundreds of thousands of scrolls.

Hellenistic philosophy saw the development of new schools of thought, such as Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Skepticism, which focused on how individuals could achieve happiness and tranquility in a chaotic world.

Hellenistic science and mathematics made significant advances. Scholars such as Euclid, who wrote "Elements," a treatise on geometry; Archimedes, who made discoveries in physics and engineering; and Eratosthenes, who calculated the circumference of the Earth with remarkable accuracy, all lived during this period.

Hellenistic art moved away from the idealism of Classical Greek art toward greater realism and emotional expressiveness. Famous works from this period include the Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.

### The End of the Hellenistic Period

The Hellenistic period came to an end with the rise of Rome. By the 1st century BCE, Rome had conquered Greece, Macedonia, and much of the Middle East, incorporating these regions into the Roman Empire.

However, Greek culture continued to influence the Roman world. The Romans admired and emulated Greek art, architecture, literature, and philosophy. Many educated Romans spoke Greek as well as Latin, and Greek tutors were in high demand among the Roman elite.

Through Rome, Greek ideas and cultural elements were preserved and transmitted to later civilizations, ensuring that the legacy of ancient Greece would continue to shape Western culture for centuries to come.

## Conclusion

Ancient Greece made profound contributions to Western civilization in areas such as government, philosophy, art, architecture, literature, and science. The concept of democracy, the pursuit of rational inquiry, the emphasis on human achievement and excellence, and the creation of enduring works of art and literature are all part of the Greek legacy.

The spread of Greek culture through colonization, trade, and conquest, particularly during the Hellenistic period, ensured that these contributions would influence a wide range of societies across Europe, North Africa, and Asia. Even after the political decline of the Greek city-states and the Hellenistic kingdoms, Greek culture continued to exert a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and, through Rome, on medieval and modern Europe.

Today, we can still see the impact of ancient Greece in our political systems, our philosophical and scientific traditions, our literature and art, and even in the words we use. The story of ancient Greece reminds us of the enduring power of ideas and the ways in which cultural exchange can shape the course of history.
