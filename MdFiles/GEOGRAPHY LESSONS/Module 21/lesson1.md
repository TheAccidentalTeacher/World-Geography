# Lesson 1: Physical Geography

## The Big Idea
The Eastern Mediterranean, a region with a dry climate and valuable resources, sits in the middle of three continents.

## Main Ideas
- The Eastern Mediterranean's physical features include the Bosporus, the Dead Sea, rivers, mountains, deserts, and plains.
- The region's climate is mostly Mediterranean, with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.
- The Eastern Mediterranean has valuable resources, including water, minerals, and energy resources.

## If YOU lived there...
You live in Izmir, Turkey, on the Aegean Sea but are traveling into the far eastern part of the country called eastern Anatolia. At home you are used to a warm, dry Mediterranean climate. You are surprised by the colder and wetter climate you're experiencing. Two mountain ranges come together here, and you notice that the peaks are covered with snow.

**How does geography affect climate in these two places?**

## Introduction to the Eastern Mediterranean

The Eastern Mediterranean region includes several countries that border the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea: Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan. This region sits at the crossroads of three continents—Europe, Asia, and Africa—making it a strategic location throughout history.

The region's unique geography has shaped its climate, resources, and human settlement patterns. From coastal plains to high mountains, from fertile river valleys to harsh deserts, the Eastern Mediterranean's diverse landscapes have influenced the development of its civilizations and cultures.

## Physical Features

The Eastern Mediterranean region has a variety of physical features that have influenced human settlement and activity.

### Waterways

Several important waterways are found in the Eastern Mediterranean:

**The Mediterranean Sea** forms the western boundary of the region. This large sea has historically been a major route for trade, travel, and cultural exchange between Europe, Africa, and Asia. The Mediterranean's eastern shores include some excellent natural harbors that have supported maritime trade for thousands of years.

**The Bosporus and Dardanelles** are narrow straits that connect the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The Bosporus separates the European and Asian parts of Turkey and is only about half a mile wide at its narrowest point. These straits are strategically important because they control access between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.

**The Dead Sea** is a salt lake that lies between Israel and Jordan. At about 1,400 feet (430 meters) below sea level, its shores are the lowest point on Earth's land surface. The Dead Sea has an extremely high salt content—about 34%—making it nearly ten times saltier than the ocean. This high salinity means that people can float effortlessly on its surface. The Dead Sea is shrinking due to water diversion from the Jordan River, which feeds it.

**The Sea of Galilee** (also called Lake Tiberias or Lake Kinneret) is Israel's largest freshwater lake. It is fed by the Jordan River, which then flows south from the lake to the Dead Sea.

**Rivers** in the region include:
- The Jordan River, which flows from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea
- The Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which originate in Turkey and flow through Syria before entering Iraq
- The Orontes River in Syria and Lebanon
- Several smaller rivers in Turkey, including the Gediz, Menderes, and Kizil

These rivers provide essential water for drinking, irrigation, and hydroelectric power in an otherwise dry region.

### Landforms

The Eastern Mediterranean has diverse landforms, from coastal plains to high mountains:

**Coastal Plains** run along parts of the Mediterranean shore in Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. These relatively flat, fertile areas support agriculture and are home to many of the region's major cities and ports.

**Mountains** form significant features in several countries:
- The Taurus Mountains run along Turkey's southern coast
- The Pontic Mountains parallel Turkey's Black Sea coast
- The Lebanon Mountains run north-south through Lebanon
- The Anti-Lebanon Mountains form part of the border between Lebanon and Syria
- Mount Hermon, at the junction of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, rises to 9,232 feet (2,814 meters)

These mountain ranges affect climate patterns by blocking rainfall and creating rain shadows. They also historically served as barriers to travel and communication.

**Plateaus** are found in several parts of the region:
- The Anatolian Plateau covers much of central Turkey
- The Syrian Plateau extends across parts of Syria and Jordan

These elevated flat lands often have distinctive climates and vegetation compared to surrounding areas.

**Deserts** cover significant portions of the region:
- The Syrian Desert extends across parts of Syria, Jordan, and Iraq
- The Negev Desert occupies southern Israel

These arid regions have limited vegetation and sparse human settlement, though some support nomadic herding.

**The Jordan Valley** is part of the Great Rift Valley, a geological fault system that extends from Syria through the Red Sea and into East Africa. This valley contains the Jordan River, the Sea of Galilee, and the Dead Sea.

### Elevation

The Eastern Mediterranean has significant variations in elevation:
- The Dead Sea shore is the lowest point on Earth's land surface at about 1,400 feet (430 meters) below sea level
- Mount Ararat in eastern Turkey reaches 16,854 feet (5,137 meters) above sea level

These elevation differences contribute to the region's diverse climates and ecosystems.

## Climate

The Eastern Mediterranean has several climate zones, though most of the region experiences a Mediterranean climate.

### Mediterranean Climate

The coastal areas of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel have a classic **Mediterranean climate**, characterized by:
- Hot, dry summers with little or no rainfall
- Mild, wet winters when most precipitation occurs
- Abundant sunshine throughout the year
- Moderate temperatures due to the influence of the Mediterranean Sea

This climate is ideal for growing crops like olives, grapes, citrus fruits, and wheat, which have been staples of the region's agriculture for thousands of years.

### Continental Climate

Moving inland and to higher elevations, particularly in central and eastern Turkey and parts of Syria and Jordan, the climate becomes more **continental**, with:
- Greater temperature extremes between summer and winter
- Colder winters with snow at higher elevations
- Less precipitation overall
- Less moderating influence from the sea

The Anatolian Plateau in Turkey experiences this continental climate, with cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers.

### Desert Climate

The Syrian Desert and the Negev Desert have an **arid climate** characterized by:
- Very little rainfall (less than 10 inches or 25 cm annually)
- Extreme temperature variations between day and night
- Hot summers and cool winters
- Low humidity

These desert regions have sparse vegetation adapted to drought conditions.

### Mountain Climate

The mountain ranges in the region have their own **mountain climate** with:
- Cooler temperatures than surrounding lowlands
- Increased precipitation, often as snow at higher elevations
- Significant temperature variations based on elevation and aspect (which direction the slope faces)
- Shorter growing seasons

The Taurus and Pontic Mountains in Turkey receive more rainfall than the interior plateau they surround.

### Climate Challenges

The Eastern Mediterranean faces several climate-related challenges:
- **Water scarcity** is a major issue, particularly in Israel, Jordan, and Syria
- **Drought** affects agriculture and water supplies
- **Desertification** threatens to expand arid areas
- **Climate change** may increase temperatures and reduce rainfall in the future

These challenges have led to conflicts over water resources and efforts to develop water conservation and management strategies.

## Natural Resources

Despite its challenging environment, the Eastern Mediterranean has valuable natural resources that have supported human civilization for millennia.

### Water Resources

In this predominantly dry region, water is perhaps the most precious resource:
- Rivers provide water for drinking, irrigation, and hydroelectric power
- Groundwater aquifers supply additional water, though many are being depleted faster than they can recharge
- The Sea of Galilee is a crucial freshwater source for Israel

Water management and conservation are critical issues throughout the region. Countries have developed extensive irrigation systems, dams, and water transfer projects to maximize their limited water resources.

### Mineral Resources

The region has various mineral deposits:
- Turkey has chromium, copper, boron, and marble
- Jordan produces phosphates used in fertilizer
- The Dead Sea contains valuable minerals including potash, bromine, and magnesium
- Israel mines potash, bromine, and phosphates

These minerals support industrial development and provide export income.

### Energy Resources

Energy resources in the Eastern Mediterranean include:
- **Oil and natural gas**: Recent discoveries of natural gas in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, particularly in Israeli and Cypriot waters, have changed the energy outlook for the region
- **Hydroelectric power**: Turkey has built numerous dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for power generation
- **Solar energy**: The region's abundant sunshine makes it ideal for solar power development
- **Wind energy**: Some coastal areas have good potential for wind power

Energy resources have both economic and geopolitical significance, sometimes leading to disputes over ownership and access.

### Agricultural Resources

Despite limited water and challenging terrain, the region has some valuable agricultural resources:
- Fertile coastal plains support intensive agriculture
- River valleys provide irrigated farmland
- Traditional Mediterranean crops like olives, grapes, and citrus thrive in the climate
- Livestock raising, particularly sheep and goats, is important in more arid areas

Agriculture remains an important economic sector in most countries of the region, though its relative importance has declined as other sectors have grown.

## Human Adaptation to the Environment

People in the Eastern Mediterranean have developed various strategies to adapt to their environment:

### Water Management

Throughout history, inhabitants of the region have created sophisticated water management systems:
- Ancient aqueducts and cisterns collected and stored rainwater
- Qanats (underground channels) tapped groundwater in arid areas
- Modern dams, reservoirs, and irrigation systems maximize available water
- Israel has pioneered water conservation techniques and desalination technology

### Settlement Patterns

Human settlement has been shaped by the physical environment:
- Major cities developed along the coast and in river valleys where water and fertile soil were available
- Mountain villages adapted to local conditions with terraced agriculture
- Desert regions supported nomadic herding rather than dense settlement
- Modern urban centers have grown where transportation routes converge

### Land Use

People have modified the landscape to make it more productive:
- Terracing of hillsides to create level farmland and prevent erosion
- Irrigation systems to water crops in dry areas
- Draining of marshes to create farmland
- Reforestation efforts to combat erosion and desertification

### Modern Challenges

Today, the region faces environmental challenges that require new adaptations:
- Growing populations increase demand for water and other resources
- Climate change may reduce rainfall and increase temperatures
- Pollution affects water quality in rivers and coastal areas
- Overgrazing and deforestation contribute to soil erosion and desertification

Countries in the region are developing policies and technologies to address these challenges, including water conservation, renewable energy, and sustainable agriculture practices.

## Strategic Importance

The Eastern Mediterranean's location at the crossroads of three continents has given it strategic importance throughout history:

### Transportation Routes

The region contains crucial transportation routes:
- The Bosporus and Dardanelles control access between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean
- Land routes connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa pass through the region
