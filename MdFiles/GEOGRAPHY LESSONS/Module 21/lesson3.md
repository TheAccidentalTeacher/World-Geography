# Lesson 3: Israel

## The Big Idea
Israel and the Palestinian Territories are home to Jews and Arabs who continue to struggle over the region's land.

## Main Ideas
- Israel was established as a Jewish homeland after World War II.
- Israel has fought several wars with neighboring Arab states.
- Israelis and Palestinians have competing claims to the same land.
- Israel has a diverse population and a strong economy.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a teenager living in Jerusalem. Your neighborhood includes both Jewish and Arab families. At school, you have friends from both groups. Recently, tensions have increased after violent incidents in the city. Some of your friends are saying they don't want to spend time with people from the other group. You want everyone to get along, but you also feel loyal to your own community.

**How would you try to maintain friendships across community lines during this tense time?**

## The Creation of Israel

The modern state of Israel was established in 1948, but its roots lie in ancient history and the Zionist movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

### Historical Background

The land that is now Israel has a complex history:
- In ancient times, it was the homeland of the Jewish people, who established kingdoms there around 1000 BCE
- The Romans conquered the region in 63 BCE and eventually expelled many Jews after failed rebellions
- For nearly 2,000 years, most Jews lived in diaspora (scattered around the world), though some remained in the region
- The area was ruled by various empires, including the Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, Mamluk, and Ottoman
- By the late 19th century, the region was part of the Ottoman Empire with a predominantly Arab population

Throughout their diaspora, many Jews maintained a connection to this homeland and included prayers for return to Jerusalem in their religious practices.

### Zionism and Jewish Immigration

**Zionism**, a movement advocating for a Jewish homeland in the historic land of Israel (then called Palestine), emerged in the late 19th century. It was driven by:
- Persistent antisemitism (prejudice against Jews) in Europe
- The rise of nationalism as a political force
- The desire for Jewish self-determination

Theodor Herzl, an Austrian Jewish journalist, formally organized the Zionist movement after witnessing antisemitism in supposedly enlightened France during the Dreyfus Affair. His 1896 book, *Der Judenstaat* (The Jewish State), argued that Jews needed their own country to escape persecution.

Jewish immigration to Palestine increased:
- The First Aliyah (1882-1903) brought about 35,000 Jews, mostly from Russia
- The Second Aliyah (1904-1914) brought another 40,000
- Immigration continued during the British Mandate period (1920-1948)

These immigrants established agricultural settlements, revived Hebrew as a spoken language, and built the foundations of a future state.

### British Mandate Period

After World War I, the Ottoman Empire collapsed, and the League of Nations granted Britain a mandate to administer Palestine. During this period (1920-1948):
- Jewish immigration continued, particularly as antisemitism increased in Europe
- Tensions grew between the Jewish and Arab communities
- The British tried to balance competing promises made to both Jews and Arabs
- The 1939 White Paper limited Jewish immigration just as the Holocaust was beginning in Europe

The Holocaust (1941-1945), in which Nazi Germany murdered six million Jews, created a sense of urgency for a Jewish state and increased international sympathy for the Zionist cause.

### UN Partition Plan and Israeli Independence

In 1947, the United Nations proposed dividing Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem under international control. This plan:
- Was accepted by Jewish leaders
- Was rejected by Arab leaders, who felt it gave too much land to the Jewish minority
- Led to civil war between Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine

On May 14, 1948, as the British Mandate ended, Jewish leaders declared the independence of the State of Israel. The next day, armies from neighboring Arab states invaded, beginning the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

Israel won this war and established its independence, but the conflict created lasting problems:
- About 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from areas that became Israel
- These refugees and their descendants, now numbering millions, still demand the right to return
- No Palestinian state was established in the areas designated for it
- Jerusalem was divided, with Israel controlling the western part and Jordan the eastern part (including the Old City)

These unresolved issues from Israel's creation continue to shape the region today.

## Arab-Israeli Conflicts

Since its establishment, Israel has fought several wars with neighboring Arab states and has faced ongoing conflict with Palestinians.

### Major Wars

**1948 Arab-Israeli War (Israeli War of Independence)**: Immediately after Israel declared independence, armies from Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq invaded. Israel prevailed and expanded beyond the UN partition boundaries. Jordan took control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, while Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip.

**1956 Suez Crisis**: Israel, in alliance with Britain and France, invaded Egypt after Egyptian President Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal and blockaded Israeli shipping. International pressure forced Israel to withdraw.

**1967 Six-Day War**: In a preemptive strike against threatening Arab armies, Israel captured:
- The Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt
- The West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan
- The Golan Heights from Syria

This brief war dramatically changed the region's geography and created new challenges, as Israel now controlled territories with large Palestinian populations.

**1973 Yom Kippur War (October War)**: Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israel during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. After initial Arab gains, Israel counterattacked successfully. The war led to peace negotiations with Egypt.

**1982 Lebanon War**: Israel invaded Lebanon to eliminate PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) bases used for attacks on Israel. Israeli forces reached Beirut, and the PLO leadership was forced to leave Lebanon. Israel occupied southern Lebanon until 2000.

**2006 Lebanon War**: Israel fought against Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shia militant group, after Hezbollah captured Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid.

### Peace Treaties

Despite decades of conflict, Israel has achieved peace with some of its neighbors:

**Egypt**: The 1978 Camp David Accords, brokered by U.S. President Jimmy Carter, led to a 1979 peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, and Egypt became the first Arab state to recognize Israel.

**Jordan**: Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty in 1994, normalizing relations and resolving border and water issues.

**Recent Normalization**: In 2020, the Abraham Accords established diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco.

However, Israel still does not have diplomatic relations with many Arab and Muslim-majority countries, including Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Iran.

## The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict

The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians over the same land has been one of the world's most persistent and complex disputes.

### Competing Claims

Both Israelis and Palestinians claim the same territory:

**Israeli Claims**:
- Historical connection to the land dating back to ancient Jewish kingdoms
- Need for a Jewish homeland after centuries of persecution
- Right to self-determination and security
- Development of previously underutilized land
- Military victory in successive wars

**Palestinian Claims**:
- Continuous presence in the land for centuries
- Right to self-determination
- Unjust displacement during Israel's creation and subsequent conflicts
- International law regarding occupied territories
- UN resolutions supporting Palestinian rights

These competing claims have made resolution extremely difficult.

### Occupied Territories and Settlements

Since the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel has occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip (until its unilateral withdrawal in 2005), and East Jerusalem. These areas are home to millions of Palestinians.

Israel has established **settlements** in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens now live. These settlements:
- Are considered illegal under international law by most countries and the United Nations
- Are viewed by Israel as legal and strategically important
- Have created a complex patchwork of Israeli and Palestinian areas in the West Bank
- Are a major obstacle to peace negotiations

### The Palestinian Authority and Hamas

Palestinians have developed their own political institutions:

**The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)**, founded in 1964, was long led by Yasser Arafat and is recognized internationally as the representative of the Palestinian people.

**The Palestinian Authority (PA)** was established in 1994 following the Oslo Accords. It has limited self-government in parts of the West Bank but lacks full sovereignty.

**Hamas**, an Islamist militant group, won Palestinian legislative elections in 2006 and took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007. It:
- Is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States, and others
- Refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist
- Has engaged in armed conflict with Israel, including rocket attacks
- Governs the Gaza Strip separately from the PA-controlled West Bank

This political division among Palestinians has complicated peace efforts.

### Peace Process and Obstacles

Numerous attempts have been made to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict:

**Oslo Accords (1993-1995)**: Created the Palestinian Authority and established a framework for negotiations on final status issues.

**Camp David Summit (2000)**: Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, mediated by U.S. President Bill Clinton, came close to an agreement but ultimately failed.

**Arab Peace Initiative (2002)**: Offered Israel normalization with all Arab states in exchange for withdrawal from occupied territories and a just solution for Palestinian refugees.

**Roadmap for Peace (2003)**: Proposed a two-state solution with an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.

**Annapolis Conference (2007)**: Renewed peace talks but achieved little progress.

**Various U.S.-led initiatives**: Including efforts by the Obama and Trump administrations.

Despite these efforts, obstacles to peace remain:
- Disagreements over Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital
- The status of Palestinian refugees
- Israeli settlements in the West Bank
- Security concerns, particularly Israeli fears of terrorism
- Water rights and access to resources
- Political divisions among Palestinians
- Opposition from hardliners on both sides

### The Separation Barrier

In response to Palestinian suicide bombings during the Second Intifada (Palestinian uprising, 2000-2005), Israel began constructing a **separation barrier** between Israeli and Palestinian areas. This barrier:
- Is partly a concrete wall and partly a fence with security zones
- Has reduced terrorist attacks against Israelis
- Cuts into West Bank territory in many places, not following the pre-1967 boundaries
- Creates hardships for many Palestinians by separating them from their lands, workplaces, and services
- Is called a "security fence" by Israelis and an "apartheid wall" by Palestinians

The barrier illustrates the tension between Israeli security concerns and Palestinian rights and mobility.

## Israeli Society and Economy

Despite ongoing conflicts, Israel has developed a diverse society and a strong, innovative economy.

### Demographics

Israel has a population of about 9.3 million people (as of 2021):
- About 74% are Jewish
- About 21% are Arab (mostly Muslim, with Christian and Druze minorities)
- About 5% are from other groups

The Jewish population includes people from diverse backgrounds:
- **Ashkenazi Jews** with roots in Eastern and Central Europe
- **Sephardic** and **Mizrahi Jews** with roots in Spain, North Africa, and the Middle East
- **Ethiopian Jews** who immigrated in the 1980s and 1990s
- **Russian Jews** who arrived after the collapse of the Soviet Union
- **Native-born Israelis** (called Sabras)

This diversity has created a multicultural society with both integration and tensions between different groups.

### Government and Politics

Israel is a parliamentary democracy with:
- A president as ceremonial head of state
- A prime minister as head of government
- A unicameral parliament called the Knesset
- A Supreme Court
- Regular elections with multiple political parties

Israeli politics includes a wide spectrum of views:
- Left-wing parties that generally favor territorial compromise with Palestinians
- Right-wing parties that emphasize security and Jewish settlement
- Religious parties that promote Jewish religious law and institutions
- Arab parties representing the interests of Arab citizens

Coalition governments are the norm, as no single party typically wins a majority of seats.

### Economy

Israel has developed one of the most advanced economies in the Middle East:
- High-tech industries, earning Israel the nickname "Start-up Nation"
- Advanced agriculture, including innovative irrigation techniques
- Diamond cutting and polishing
- Tourism, particularly religious tourism
- Military and security technology
- Pharmaceuticals and medical devices

Israel invests heavily in research and development and has one of the highest numbers of scientists and engineers per capita in the world.

Challenges to the economy include:
- High cost of living, particularly housing
- Income inequality
- Economic disparities between Jewish and Arab citizens
- High defense spending
- Limited natural resources

### Religion and Culture

Religion plays an important role in Israeli society:

**Judaism** is the majority religion and influences many aspects of public life:
- Saturday (Shabbat) is the official day of rest
- Jewish holidays are national holidays
- Kosher dietary laws are observed in many public institutions
- Marriage and divorce for Jews are controlled by religious authorities
- There is ongoing debate about the role of religion in the state

**Islam** is practiced by most Arab citizens, who have their own religious institutions and courts for family law.

**Christianity** is practiced by a small minority, including both Arabs and immigrants.

Israeli culture is diverse and dynamic:
- Hebrew literature, from ancient texts to modern novels
- Music ranging from traditional to contemporary pop and rock
- Cinema that has gained international recognition
- Visual arts and architecture
- Cuisine that blends influences from Jewish communities worldwide

### Education and Innovation

Israel places a high value on education:
- Mandatory education from ages 5 to 18
- High literacy rate (97.8%)
- Prestigious universities like Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University, and the Technion
- Strong emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)

This educational foundation has supported Israel's emergence as an innovation hub:
- More start-up companies per capita than any other country
- Major research and development centers for international tech companies
- Innovations in water conservation, agriculture, medicine, and cybersecurity
- Strong venture capital ecosystem

## Palestinian Society

Palestinians living in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem face different circumstances than those in Israel or neighboring countries.

### West Bank

The West Bank is home to about 3 million Palestinians. Their situation is characterized by:
- Partial self-rule under the Palestinian Authority in some areas
- Israeli military control in other areas
- Restrictions on movement due to checkpoints and the separation barrier
- Economic challenges, including high unemployment
- Limited access to water and other resources
- Impact of Israeli settlements and their associated infrastructure

Major cities include Ramallah (the de facto administrative capital), Nablus, Hebron, and Bethlehem.

### Gaza Strip

The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with about 2 million Palestinians living in an area of just 141 square miles (365 square kilometers). Conditions include:
- Rule by Hamas since 2007
- Israeli and Egyptian blockade limiting movement of people and goods
- Severe economic problems with unemployment over 40%
- Limited electricity and clean water
- Periodic conflicts with Israel causing destruction and casualties
- One of the world's highest population growth rates

### East Jerusalem

East Jerusalem, including the Old City with its important religious sites, was annexed by Israel after the 1967 war. Palestinians there:
- Generally have "permanent resident" status rather than Israeli citizenship
- Face housing shortages and restrictions on building
- Have limited political representation
- Consider East Jerusalem the capital of their future state

### Palestinian Refugees

About 5.7 million Palestinians are registered as refugees with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). These include:
- Those who fled or were expelled from what became Israel in 1948 and their descendants
- Those displaced by the 1967 war

Many live in refugee camps in:
- The West Bank and Gaza Strip
- Jordan
- Lebanon
- Syria

The status and right of return of these refugees remains one of the most difficult issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

### Palestinian Economy and Culture

Despite challenging circumstances, Palestinians maintain distinctive economic activities and cultural traditions:

**Economy**:
- Agriculture, including olive oil production
- Stone and marble quarrying
- Textiles and handicrafts
- Tourism, particularly in Bethlehem
- Services and information technology in urban areas

**Culture**:
- Rich tradition of poetry and literature
- Music and dance, including the dabke (traditional folk dance)
- Embroidery and other traditional crafts
- Cuisine featuring dishes like maqluba, musakhan, and knafeh
- Strong emphasis on family and community ties

## Jerusalem: A Contested City

Jerusalem holds special significance for Jews, Christians, and Muslims, making it one of the world's most contested cities.

### Religious Significance

**For Jews**: Jerusalem is Judaism's holiest city:
- The Temple Mount, site of the ancient Jewish Temples
- The Western Wall (Kotel), the last remnant of the Second Temple complex
- The City of David, the oldest settled part of Jerusalem
- Numerous synagogues and yeshivas (religious schools)

**For Christians**: Jerusalem is where key events in Jesus's life occurred:
- The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, built over the traditional sites of Jesus's crucifixion and burial
- The Via Dolorosa, the path Jesus reportedly walked to his crucifixion
- The Mount of Olives, where Jesus prayed before his arrest
- The Room of the Last Supper on Mount Zion

**For Muslims**: Jerusalem is Islam's third-holiest city:
- The Al-Aqsa Mosque, mentioned in the Quran
- The Dome of the Rock, built over the spot where Muslims believe Muhammad ascended to heaven
- The entire Noble Sanctuary (Haram al-Sharif), which encompasses the same area as the Temple Mount

### Political Status

Jerusalem's political status is highly contested:
- Israel considers Jerusalem its "eternal and undivided capital"
- Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state
- Most countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv rather than Jerusalem
- In 2017, the United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved its embassy there, a controversial decision
- The United Nations considers East Jerusalem occupied territory

### Current Situation

Today, Jerusalem is:
- Governed by Israel, which annexed East Jerusalem in 1980
- Home to about 936,000 people, including both Jews and Arabs
- Physically united but socially divided, with most Jews living in West Jerusalem and most Arabs in East Jerusalem
- The site of frequent tensions, particularly around the Old City and its religious sites
- A symbol of the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict

## Prospects for Peace

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the world's most intractable disputes, but various solutions have been proposed.

### Two-State Solution

The most widely supported approach internationally is the **two-state solution**:
- An independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
- Israel within secure and recognized boundaries
- Special arrangements for Jerusalem
- Resolution of the refugee issue

Challenges to this solution include:
- Israeli settlements in the West Bank
- Palestinian political division between the PA and Hamas
- Disagreements over Jerusalem
- Security concerns
- Water rights
- Lack of trust between the parties

### One-State Approaches

Some advocate for a **one-state solution** with equal rights for all inhabitants between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. This could take different forms:
- A binational state with guaranteed rights for both national groups
- A secular democratic state with no official ethnic or religious character

Critics argue that:
- This would end Israel's character as a Jewish state
- The deep divisions between the populations would make governance difficult
- Neither side's national aspirations would be fully met

### Current Realities

The current situation is characterized by:
- Continued Israeli control of the West Bank
- Hamas control of Gaza
- Periodic outbreaks of violence
- Diplomatic stalemate
- "Facts on the ground" that make a two-state solution increasingly difficult
- Growing international criticism of Israel's policies in the occupied territories
- Persistent Palestinian demands for self-determination

Despite these challenges, many Israelis and Palestinians continue to work for peace through civil society organizations, people-to-people initiatives, and advocacy for a negotiated solution.
