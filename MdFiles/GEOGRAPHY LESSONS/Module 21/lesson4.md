# Lesson 4: Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan

## The Big Idea
Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan are Arab nations coping with religious diversity.

## Main Ideas
- Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan share many cultural and historical similarities.
- Each country has a unique mix of religious and ethnic groups.
- These countries face challenges including political instability, refugee crises, and economic difficulties.
- Despite challenges, these countries have rich cultural traditions and are working to develop their economies.

## If YOU lived there...
You live in Amman, Jordan. Your country has taken in more than a million refugees from neighboring Syria, where a civil war has been raging for years. Your school has many Syrian students, and a Syrian family has moved into an apartment in your building. Your parents say that helping refugees is important, but you've heard other people complain that the refugees are putting a strain on Jordan's limited resources.

**How might you help the Syrian refugees in your community while understanding the concerns of some Jordanians?**

## Historical Background

Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan share many historical experiences that have shaped their development as modern nations.

### Ancient History

The region that now includes Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan has a rich ancient history:
- Phoenicians established city-states along the Lebanese coast around 1500 BCE
- Arameans created kingdoms in what is now Syria
- Various empires controlled the region, including Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, and Roman
- The area was an important center of early Christianity
- The Nabataean kingdom, with its capital at Petra (in modern Jordan), controlled trade routes

### Islamic Era

The Arab-Islamic conquest in the 7th century CE transformed the region:
- Arabic became the dominant language
- Islam became the majority religion, though significant Christian communities remained
- The region became part of various Islamic empires, including the Umayyad, Abbasid, and Ottoman

### Ottoman Period

The Ottoman Empire ruled the region from the early 16th century until World War I:
- The area was divided into administrative provinces
- Local notables and tribal leaders maintained significant autonomy
- Religious communities had their own legal systems for personal status matters
- Economic development lagged behind Europe
- Nationalism began to emerge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries

### French Mandate Period

After the Ottoman Empire's defeat in World War I, the League of Nations granted France mandates over Syria and Lebanon:
- France created Greater Lebanon in 1920, adding predominantly Muslim areas to the historically Christian Mount Lebanon
- Syria was initially divided into several states before being unified
- France promoted the interests of Christians, particularly Maronites in Lebanon
- Nationalist movements opposed French rule
- Syria and Lebanon gained independence during World War II (Syria in 1946, Lebanon in 1943)

### British Mandate and the Creation of Jordan

Britain received a mandate over Palestine, from which Jordan eventually emerged:
- In 1921, Britain separated the area east of the Jordan River from Palestine
- This territory, called Transjordan, was placed under the rule of Emir Abdullah of the Hashemite family
- Transjordan gained independence in 1946 and was renamed the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1949
- After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jordan annexed the West Bank and East Jerusalem (lost to Israel in 1967)

### Post-Independence Developments

After independence, these countries followed different paths:
- Syria experienced political instability, including numerous coups, before the Assad family established authoritarian rule in 1970
- Lebanon maintained a fragile sectarian democracy that collapsed into civil war (1975-1990)
- Jordan developed as a relatively stable monarchy under the Hashemite dynasty

Despite these differences, all three countries have been deeply affected by regional conflicts, particularly the Arab-Israeli dispute and more recently the Syrian Civil War.

## Syria

Syria is the largest and most populous of the three countries, but has been devastated by civil war since 2011.

### Geography

Syria covers about 71,500 square miles (185,180 square kilometers) and has diverse geography:
- Mediterranean coastal plain in the west
- Mountain ranges parallel to the coast
- Fertile river valleys, particularly along the Euphrates
- Desert regions in the east and south
- Borders with Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon

Major cities include:
- Damascus, the capital and one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities
- Aleppo, historically a major trading center
- Homs, an industrial center
- Latakia, the main port

### Government and Politics

Syria has been ruled by the Assad family since 1970:
- Hafez al-Assad took power in a coup and ruled until his death in 2000
- His son Bashar al-Assad succeeded him
- The country is officially a republic but functions as an authoritarian state
- The Ba'ath Party has been the dominant political force
- Security services maintain tight control over the population

The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011 as part of the Arab Spring protests, has fragmented the country:
- Government forces control most major cities and the western part of the country
- Various opposition groups control different areas
- Kurdish forces control much of the northeast
- The Islamic State (ISIS) held significant territory but has been largely defeated
- Foreign powers, including Russia, Iran, Turkey, and the United States, are involved in the conflict

### Economy

Before the civil war, Syria's economy was based on:
- Agriculture, including wheat, cotton, and olives
- Oil and natural gas production
- Light industry
- Tourism

The war has devastated the economy:
- GDP has declined by more than 60%
- Infrastructure has been destroyed
- Millions have been displaced from their homes and jobs
- International sanctions have limited trade
- The currency has collapsed in value

Reconstruction will require massive investment, but political resolution remains elusive.

### People and Society

Syria has a population of about 17 million (pre-war estimates were around 22 million, but millions have fled):
- Arabs are the largest ethnic group (about 90%)
- Kurds form the largest minority (about 10%)
- Smaller groups include Turkmen, Armenians, and Circassians

Religious diversity is significant:
- Sunni Muslims are the majority (about 74%)
- Alawites (a branch of Shia Islam) form about 12% and dominate the government
- Christians of various denominations make up about 10%
- Druze and other minorities constitute the remainder

The Assad regime has been dominated by Alawites, creating tensions with the Sunni majority. Religious minorities have generally supported the government, fearing persecution if Islamist opposition groups take power.

### The Syrian Refugee Crisis

The civil war has created one of the world's worst refugee crises:
- Over 5.6 million Syrians have fled to neighboring countries
- About 6.7 million are internally displaced within Syria
- Turkey hosts the largest number of Syrian refugees (about 3.6 million)
- Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt also host significant numbers
- Over a million Syrians have sought asylum in Europe

This massive displacement has created humanitarian challenges and political tensions in host countries.

## Lebanon

Lebanon is the smallest of the three countries but has a unique political system based on religious power-sharing.

### Geography

Lebanon covers just 4,036 square miles (10,452 square kilometers), about the size of Connecticut:
- Narrow coastal plain along the Mediterranean
- Lebanon Mountains running parallel to the coast
- Fertile Bekaa Valley between the mountain ranges
- Anti-Lebanon Mountains along the eastern border with Syria

Major cities include:
- Beirut, the capital and largest city
- Tripoli, the second-largest city
- Sidon and Tyre, ancient ports
- Baalbek, famous for its Roman ruins

### Government and Politics

Lebanon has a confessional political system that divides power among religious communities:
- The president must be a Maronite Christian
- The prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim
- The speaker of parliament must be a Shia Muslim
- Parliamentary seats are allocated by religious quotas

This system, established by the National Pact of 1943 and modified by the 1989 Taif Agreement, aims to ensure representation for all groups but has also entrenched sectarian divisions.

Lebanon's recent history has been marked by:
- Civil war (1975-1990) that killed over 100,000 people
- Syrian military presence (1976-2005)
- Israeli invasions and occupation of southern Lebanon (1978-2000)
- The 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah
- Political gridlock and governance challenges
- The devastating Beirut port explosion in 2020
- A severe economic crisis beginning in 2019

### Economy

Lebanon's economy has traditionally been service-oriented:
- Banking and finance
- Tourism
- Trade and commerce
- Real estate
- Small-scale manufacturing
- Agriculture in the Bekaa Valley

However, the country is now experiencing its worst economic crisis in decades:
- Currency collapse, with the Lebanese pound losing over 90% of its value
- Banking crisis with restrictions on withdrawals
- Hyperinflation
- Widespread poverty
- Shortages of basic goods, including fuel and medicine
- Infrastructure deterioration, including frequent power outages

Recovery will require significant reforms and international support.

### People and Society

Lebanon has a population of about 6.8 million, including refugees:
- Arabs form the majority
- Armenian, Kurdish, and other minorities are present

Religious diversity is Lebanon's defining characteristic:
- Christians of various denominations (primarily Maronite, Greek Orthodox, and Greek Catholic) constitute about 40%
- Muslims (both Sunni and Shia) make up about 54%
- Druze account for about 5%
- Small Jewish community remains

Lebanon has historically been more culturally liberal than its neighbors:
- Vibrant arts scene
- Free press (though under pressure)
- Active civil society
- High educational standards
- Strong diaspora connections, particularly to France and the Americas

### Challenges and Opportunities

Lebanon faces significant challenges:
- Political dysfunction and corruption
- Economic crisis
- Refugee burden (Lebanon hosts about 1.5 million Syrian refugees)
- Hezbollah's role as a "state within a state"
- Environmental degradation
- Brain drain as educated Lebanese emigrate

Opportunities include:
- Educated workforce
- Entrepreneurial tradition
- Strong diaspora that could invest
- Tourism potential
- Offshore natural gas deposits

## Contemporary Challenges

Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan face several common challenges in the 21st century.

### Political Stability and Governance

Each country faces governance challenges:
- Syria remains mired in civil war with no clear path to resolution
- Lebanon suffers from political gridlock and the influence of sectarian leaders
- Jordan maintains stability but faces pressure for greater democratization

### Economic Development

Economic challenges include:
- High unemployment, particularly among youth
- Need for economic diversification
- Water scarcity affecting agriculture and urban areas
- Energy dependence
- Impact of regional conflicts on trade and tourism
- Brain drain as educated citizens emigrate

### Regional Conflicts

The broader Middle East's conflicts affect these countries:
- The Syrian Civil War has devastated Syria and sent refugees to Lebanon and Jordan
- The Israeli-Palestinian conflict influences politics and security
- Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia create pressure to take sides
- The rise and fall of ISIS has had security implications

### Water Scarcity

Water is a critical issue in this arid region:
- The Jordan River basin is heavily exploited by Israel, Jordan, and Syria
- Groundwater is being depleted faster than it can be replenished
- Climate change is reducing rainfall and increasing temperatures
- Growing populations increase demand for water
- Agriculture consumes the majority of water resources

### Religious Coexistence

Managing religious diversity remains a challenge:
- Sectarian tensions contributed to Lebanon's civil war and continue to affect its politics
- Syria's civil war has taken on sectarian dimensions
- Jordan has maintained religious harmony but must navigate sensitivities
- Religious extremism threatens minorities and moderates

## Future Prospects

Despite significant challenges, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan have potential paths forward.

### Syria's Reconstruction

Syria faces enormous reconstruction needs:
- Rebuilding destroyed cities and infrastructure
- Reintegrating displaced populations
- Political reconciliation between government and opposition
- Addressing the legacy of violence and human rights abuses
- Reestablishing economic connections with neighbors

International support will be crucial, but political resolution must come first.

### Lebanon's Reform Agenda

Lebanon needs fundamental reforms:
- Financial sector restructuring
- Anti-corruption measures
- Electricity sector rehabilitation
- Public administration reform
- Reduction of sectarianism in politics

The 2020 port explosion and economic crisis have created both urgency and opportunity for change.

### Jordan's Development Strategy

Jordan is pursuing development through:
- Education and technology sector growth
- Renewable energy projects
- Water conservation and management
- Tourism development
- Regional economic integration

The country's stability gives it advantages, but limited resources remain a constraint.

### Regional Cooperation

Greater cooperation could benefit all three countries:
- Water management in shared river basins
- Energy networks and trade
- Transportation infrastructure
- Environmental protection
- Refugee support

However, political differences and historical tensions make cooperation challenging.
