# Lesson 6: Kingdoms of Kush

## The Big Idea
The kingdoms of Kush, which arose south of Egypt, developed advanced civilizations with large trading networks.

## Main Ideas
- Kush was influenced by Egyptian culture but maintained its own identity.
- Kushite kings conquered and ruled Egypt for nearly a century.
- Kush developed a unique culture with its own language, religion, and artistic traditions.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a merchant living in the Kushite capital of Meroë around 200 CE. Your city is a busy trading center where goods from throughout Africa, the Mediterranean world, and even India are bought and sold. Your family specializes in trading iron, which is produced in the many furnaces around the city. Recently, a trader from Egypt has offered to exchange fine pottery and glass for your iron goods.

## Geography and Origins of Kush

The kingdom of Kush developed in the region of Nubia, in what is now northern Sudan and southern Egypt, along the Nile River valley south of Egypt.

### The Land of Nubia

#### Geographic Features
Nubia occupied the Nile Valley between the First Cataract and the Sixth Cataract:
- **Cataracts**: Rocky rapids in the Nile that made river navigation difficult
- **Narrow Nile Valley**: More confined than in Egypt, with less farmland
- **Eastern Desert**: Extending to the Red Sea, rich in mineral resources
- **Western Desert**: Part of the Sahara, largely inhospitable
- **Savanna**: Areas of grassland beyond the river valley

#### Climate and Environment
The environment was more challenging than in Egypt:
- Hotter and drier climate
- Less predictable Nile flooding
- More limited agricultural land
- Abundant mineral resources, especially gold
- Wildlife including elephants, giraffes, and leopards

#### Natural Resources
Nubia was rich in valuable resources:
- **Gold**: Extensive mines in the Eastern Desert
- **Copper**: Used for tools and weapons
- **Iron ore**: Became crucial during the Meroitic period
- **Stone**: Various types for building and sculpture
- **Ivory**: From elephants hunted in the savanna regions
- **Ebony**: Prized dark wood from southern forests
- **Incense**: Aromatic resins used in religious ceremonies

### Early Nubian Cultures

#### Prehistoric Nubia
Archaeological evidence shows early sophisticated cultures:
- Neolithic settlements dating back to 5000 BCE
- Early cattle herding and agriculture
- Distinctive pottery traditions
- Complex burial practices indicating social stratification
- Trade connections with Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa

#### A-Group (c. 3800-3100 BCE)
The A-Group culture flourished in Lower Nubia:
- Contemporary with Predynastic and Early Dynastic Egypt
- Engaged in trade with Egypt
- Developed sophisticated crafts
- Created distinctive black-topped red pottery
- Gradually absorbed or displaced by Egyptian expansion

#### C-Group (c. 2400-1550 BCE)
The C-Group emerged in Lower Nubia during Egypt's Old Kingdom:
- Pastoral society with distinctive pottery and burial customs
- Maintained independence despite Egyptian pressure
- Traded with Egypt and other neighboring regions
- Gradually adopted some Egyptian cultural elements
- Eventually came under Egyptian control during the New Kingdom

#### Kerma Culture (c. 2500-1500 BCE)
The most sophisticated early Nubian civilization developed at Kerma:
- Urban center with monumental architecture
- Distinctive religious practices including human sacrifice
- Advanced metalworking and pottery production
- Extensive trade networks
- Powerful enough to challenge Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period
- Eventually conquered by Egypt during the New Kingdom

### Egyptian-Nubian Relations

#### Early Interactions
Egypt and Nubia had complex relations from the earliest periods:
- Trade in gold, ivory, ebony, and exotic animals
- Cultural exchange visible in artistic motifs
- Occasional military conflicts
- Marriage alliances between elites
- Religious influences in both directions

#### Egyptian Colonization
During periods of strength, Egypt established control over Nubia:
- Old Kingdom expeditions for resources and trade
- Middle Kingdom conquest and construction of fortresses
- New Kingdom incorporation as a province with Egyptian administration
- Introduction of Egyptian religion, language, and customs
- Construction of temples to Egyptian gods

#### Egyptianization and Resistance
Nubian responses to Egyptian influence varied:
- Adoption of Egyptian religious practices and artistic styles
- Maintenance of distinct Nubian cultural elements
- Periodic rebellions against Egyptian control
- Development of hybrid cultural forms
- Preservation of local leadership structures under Egyptian oversight

## The Kingdom of Kush

After the decline of the New Kingdom, Egyptian control over Nubia weakened. In this power vacuum, a new kingdom emerged centered at Napata near the Fourth Cataract of the Nile.

### Rise of Napata

#### Formation of the Kingdom
Around 900 BCE, a new political entity formed in Upper Nubia:
- Centered at Napata, near the holy mountain of Jebel Barkal
- Unified previously separate Nubian principalities
- Adopted elements of Egyptian culture, especially religion
- Maintained distinctly Nubian characteristics
- Gradually expanded control northward

#### Early Kushite Kings
The early rulers established the foundations of the kingdom:
- Built temples to the Egyptian god Amun, whom they identified with local deities
- Developed a distinctive royal ideology blending Egyptian and Nubian elements
- Created a centralized administration
- Controlled trade routes between Egypt, central Africa, and the Red Sea
- Maintained independence as Egypt fragmented during its Third Intermediate Period

#### Kushite Culture at Napata
The Napatan period saw a distinctive cultural synthesis:
- Egyptian-style temples with Nubian modifications
- Hieroglyphic writing used for official inscriptions
- Egyptian religious practices adapted to local traditions
- Distinctive burial customs including steep-sided pyramids
- Unique royal regalia combining Egyptian and Nubian elements

### The Kushite Conquest of Egypt

#### Expansion Northward
As Egypt weakened, Kush expanded its influence:
- Gradually extended control into Upper Egypt
- Presented themselves as defenders of traditional Egyptian religion
- Formed alliances with Egyptian priests and nobles
- Exploited divisions among competing Egyptian rulers
- Positioned themselves as restorers of ma'at (cosmic order)

#### The 25th Dynasty
Around 747 BCE, King Piye (also called Piankhy) conquered Egypt:
- Defeated the various local rulers controlling different parts of Egypt
- Established what Egyptologists call the 25th Dynasty
- Ruled Egypt from Napata while maintaining Kushite identity
- Portrayed themselves as traditional Egyptian pharaohs
- Initiated a revival of traditional Egyptian art and religion

#### Kushite Rule in Egypt
The Kushite pharaohs governed Egypt for nearly a century (c. 747-656 BCE):
- Respected Egyptian traditions and religious practices
- Restored and expanded Egyptian temples
- Revived artistic styles from earlier Egyptian periods
- Maintained Kushite customs alongside Egyptian ones
- Faced challenges from Assyrian expansion in the Near East

#### Notable Kushite Pharaohs
Several Kushite kings made significant impacts as Egyptian pharaohs:
- **Piye**: Conquered Egypt and established Kushite rule
- **Shabaka**: Consolidated control and promoted religious revival
- **Taharqa**: Longest-reigning Kushite pharaoh, engaged in extensive building projects and fought against Assyrian expansion
- **Tantamani**: Last Kushite ruler of Egypt, eventually driven back to Nubia by the Assyrians

### Assyrian Invasion and Aftermath

#### Assyrian Conquest
The powerful Neo-Assyrian Empire eventually ended Kushite rule in Egypt:
- Series of invasions beginning in the 670s BCE
- Capture and sack of Memphis and Thebes
- Forced retreat of Kushite forces to Nubia
- Installation of Assyrian-backed Egyptian rulers

- Shifted focus to controlling trade routes in Upper Nubia

#### Post-Egyptian Period
The kingdom continued to flourish after losing control of Egypt:
- Maintained diplomatic relations with Egypt
- Continued building temples and pyramids
- Developed more distinctive artistic styles
- Expanded trade networks into central and eastern Africa
- Gradually shifted their capital southward to Meroë

## The Kingdom of Meroë

Around 300 BCE, the center of the Kushite kingdom shifted from Napata to Meroë, located between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts of the Nile. This move marked the beginning of a new phase in Kushite civilization.

### The Move to Meroë

#### Reasons for Relocation
Several factors likely contributed to the shift of the capital:
- More defensible location further from Egypt
