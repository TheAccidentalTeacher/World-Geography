# Lesson 2: Sumerian Civilization

## The Big Idea
The Sumerians developed the first civilization in Mesopotamia.

## Main Ideas
- Sumerian city-states had organized governments led by kings.
- Sumerians were polytheistic and built ziggurats to honor their gods.
- Sumerians made many advances, including the invention of the wheel and the development of a writing system.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a young person living in the Sumerian city of Ur. Your father is a scribe who writes down the records of trade and taxes for the temple. He has arranged for you to go to the temple school to learn to be a scribe, too. You know that few people learn to read and write, and that scribes are respected and well paid. But the school is very strict, and you will have to study for many years.

**Would you want to become a scribe? Why or why not?**

## Sumerian City-States

Around 3500 BCE, the Sumerians established the world's first civilization in southern Mesopotamia. Their society was organized around independent city-states that dominated the region for nearly 2,000 years.

### The Rise of Sumerian Cities

#### Early Development
The first Sumerian settlements appeared along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers around 5000 BCE:
- Villages gradually grew into towns and then cities
- By 3500 BCE, true urban centers had emerged
- Cities were built on slightly elevated ground to protect from flooding
- Each city controlled the surrounding agricultural land

#### Major Sumerian Cities
Important Sumerian city-states included:
- **Uruk**: One of the earliest and largest cities, with massive walls and temples
- **Ur**: A major commercial center with access to the Persian Gulf
- **Eridu**: Considered by Sumerians to be the oldest city, dedicated to the god Enki
- **Nippur**: A religious center sacred to all Sumerians
- **Kish**: An early center of political power
- **Lagash**: Known for its artistic achievements and royal inscriptions

#### City Layout and Architecture
Sumerian cities shared common features:
- Central temple complex dedicated to the city's patron deity
- Ziggurat (stepped pyramid) as the most prominent structure
- Defensive walls surrounding the city
- Narrow, winding streets
- Houses built of sun-dried mud bricks
- Separate districts for different crafts and activities
- Canals and waterways for transportation and irrigation

### Political Organization

#### City-State Structure
Each Sumerian city functioned as an independent political entity:
- Controlled its own territory and resources
- Had its own government and laws
- Maintained its own military forces
- Worshipped its own patron deity
- Engaged in trade, diplomacy, and sometimes warfare with other city-states

#### Evolution of Leadership
Sumerian political leadership evolved over time:
- Early cities may have been governed by councils of elders
- Religious leaders (en or ensi) initially held significant power
- Military leaders (lugal, meaning "big man") gained importance during conflicts
- Eventually, the position of lugal became hereditary, creating dynasties
- Kings claimed divine approval for their rule

#### Social Classes
Sumerian society was hierarchical:
- **Kings and royal families**: Held political power and vast wealth
- **Priests**: Managed temple affairs and performed religious ceremonies
- **Nobles and officials**: Administered the city and owned large estates
- **Merchants and artisans**: Formed a middle class in urban areas
- **Farmers**: Constituted the majority of the population
