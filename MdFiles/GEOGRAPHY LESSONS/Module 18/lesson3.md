# Lesson 3: Later Peoples of the Fertile Crescent

## The Big Idea
After the Sumerians, many cultures ruled parts of the Fertile Crescent.

## Main Ideas
- Empires in Mesopotamia rose and fell as different groups fought for control.
- The Babylonians created one of the world's first written law codes.
- The Phoenicians spread their alphabet through trade.
- The Lydians invented the first coins.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a merchant living in the ancient city of Babylon. Your king, Hammurabi, has just announced a new set of laws for the kingdom. These laws will be carved on stone pillars for all to see. You have heard that the laws cover everything from business deals to family matters. Some people say the laws are very strict, with harsh punishments.

**How might a clear set of written laws help you in your business?**

## Empires of Mesopotamia

After the Sumerians established the world's first civilization, various peoples and empires rose to power in Mesopotamia, each building upon and adapting the cultural foundations laid by the Sumerians.

### The Akkadian Empire

#### Rise of Akkad
Around 2334 BCE, Sargon of Akkad conquered the Sumerian city-states:
- Sargon began as a cup-bearer to the king of Kish
- He seized power and established his capital at Akkad (location still unknown)
- He conquered all of Sumer and extended his control north into Syria
- Created the world's first multi-ethnic empire
- Ruled for approximately 56 years according to tradition

#### Akkadian Rule
The Akkadians established new patterns of imperial governance:
- Appointed Akkadian governors to rule conquered cities
- Standardized weights and measures throughout the empire
- Maintained a standing army
- Controlled trade routes from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean
- Collected tribute from subject peoples

#### Cultural Integration
The Akkadians adopted many elements of Sumerian culture:
- Used cuneiform writing, adapting it to the Akkadian language (a Semitic language)
- Worshipped Sumerian gods alongside their own deities
- Continued Sumerian artistic traditions while developing their own style
- Preserved Sumerian literature and religious practices
- Created bilingual texts in Sumerian and Akkadian

#### Decline and Fall
The Akkadian Empire lasted about 180 years:
- Faced rebellions from conquered territories
- Suffered attacks from mountain peoples called Gutians
- Experienced environmental problems, possibly including drought
- Collapsed around 2154 BCE
- Fragmented into smaller states

### The Babylonian Empire

#### First Babylonian Dynasty
Around 1894 BCE, the Amorites, a Semitic people, established a dynasty at Babylon:
- Initially a minor city-state on the Euphrates River
- Rose to prominence under King Hammurabi (r. 1792-1750 BCE)
- Conquered neighboring states including Larsa, Mari, and Eshnunna

#### Hammurabi's Code
One of Hammurabi's most significant achievements was his law code:

#### Decline of the First Babylonian Dynasty
After Hammurabi's death, the empire gradually weakened:
- His son Samsu-iluna lost control of southern Mesopotamia
- Subsequent kings ruled a reduced territory
- Hittite raids weakened the kingdom
- In 1595 BCE, the Hittites sacked Babylon
- The Kassites, a people from the Zagros Mountains, took control of Babylon

- Developed as a trading society with colonies in Anatolia
- Experienced periods of independence and foreign domination
- Worshipped the god Ashur as their chief deity

- The Persians incorporated Babylonia into their larger empire
- Babylon remained an important city but never again ruled independently

## Other Peoples of the Fertile Crescent

Beyond the major empires of Mesopotamia, several other peoples made significant contributions to the development of civilization in the Fertile Crescent.

### The Hittites

#### Origins and Expansion
The Hittites established a powerful kingdom in Anatolia (modern Turkey):

- Consisted of 22 symbols representing consonant sounds
- Much simpler than earlier writing systems like cuneiform or hieroglyphics
- Adapted by the Greeks, who added vowels

#### Political Organization
The Phoenicians organized themselves into independent city-states:
- Each city ruled by a king, often with a council of elders

- Royal messengers could travel the entire road in about a week
- According to Herodotus, "Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor darkness of night prevents these couriers from completing their designated stages with utmost speed"

- After Alexander's death, his generals divided the empire
- Persian culture continued to influence the region under later rulers

The Persian achievement in uniting the diverse peoples of the Fertile Crescent represented the culmination of nearly 3,000 years of civilizational development in the region. Their empire created a model of multicultural governance that would influence later empires from Rome to the modern era.
