# Lesson 5: The Middle and New Kingdoms

## The Big Idea
During the Middle and New Kingdoms, order was restored in Egypt, and Egyptians made lasting achievements in writing, art, and architecture.

## Main Ideas
- After a period of disorder, the Middle Kingdom brought stability and cultural achievements.
- During the Second Intermediate Period, foreign rulers called the Hyksos controlled parts of Egypt.
- The New Kingdom was a time of empire building, prosperity, and magnificent temples.

## If YOU lived there...
You are an artist living in Egypt during the New Kingdom. You have been hired to decorate the walls of a new temple being built by the pharaoh. The walls will be covered with scenes showing the pharaoh's great victories in battle. You know that there are strict rules about how to portray the pharaoh and other people. The pharaoh must always be shown as larger than anyone else, and in poses that show his power and divine nature.

**How would these artistic rules affect your work?**

## The Middle Kingdom (c. 2055-1650 BCE)

After the collapse of the Old Kingdom, Egypt entered a period of political fragmentation known as the First Intermediate Period. Around 2055 BCE, Egypt was reunified, beginning the era known as the Middle Kingdom.

### Reunification and Restoration

#### End of the First Intermediate Period
The First Intermediate Period (c. 2181-2055 BCE) was characterized by:
- Division of Egypt between competing centers of power
- Local rulers claiming royal titles
- Economic difficulties and possible climate change
- Cultural regionalism
- Social upheaval and questioning of traditional values

#### Rise of the 11th Dynasty
Reunification came from Thebes in Upper Egypt:
- Mentuhotep II (r. 2055-2004 BCE) defeated the rulers of northern Egypt
- Reestablished a centralized government
- Restored royal authority and religious traditions
- Built an innovative mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahari
- Revived trade networks and mining expeditions

#### 12th Dynasty and Stability
The 12th Dynasty, founded by Amenemhat I (r. 1985-1955 BCE), consolidated the restoration:
- Moved the capital to Itj-tawy, near the entrance to the Fayum region
- Established a strong central administration
- Created a standing army
- Secured borders and expanded territory
- Instituted co-regency (father and son ruling together) for smooth succession

### Political and Social Developments

#### Changes in Kingship
The concept of kingship evolved during the Middle Kingdom:

- Royal propaganda emphasized the king as a shepherd of his people
- Literature depicted kings seeking advice and showing concern for justice
- Greater emphasis on the king's responsibility to maintain ma'at (cosmic order)
- More accessible royal imagery and language

#### Administrative Reforms
The government was reorganized for greater efficiency:
- Power of nomarchs (provincial governors) limited
- More direct royal control over resources
- Expanded bureaucracy with more commoners in official positions
- Improved record-keeping and census-taking
- Standardized taxation system

#### Social Mobility
The Middle Kingdom saw changes in social structure:
- Increased opportunities for talented commoners to rise in government service
- Growth of a middle class of skilled artisans and officials
- More widespread literacy among administrative classes

#### External Pressures
Foreign influences contributed to the decline:

Around 1650 BCE, the Middle Kingdom collapsed:

- Cultural continuity maintained despite political division
- The stage was set for a new struggle for reunification

## The Second Intermediate Period and the Hyksos (c. 1650-1550 BCE)

The Second Intermediate Period was a time of political division when foreign rulers known as the Hyksos controlled northern Egypt while native Egyptian dynasties maintained power in the south.

### The Hyksos Rule

#### Origins and Rise to Power
The Hyksos were people of Semitic origin from the Levant (Syria-Palestine):
- Gradually settled in the eastern Delta during the late Middle Kingdom
- Established a capital at Avaris
- Took advantage of the weakening central government

- Allowed considerable cultural continuity in areas they controlled

#### Military and Technological Innovations
The Hyksos introduced important military innovations to Egypt:

- His son Kamose continued the fight
- Kamose conducted successful campaigns against Hyksos territories
- Captured Hyksos outposts and disrupted their alliances
