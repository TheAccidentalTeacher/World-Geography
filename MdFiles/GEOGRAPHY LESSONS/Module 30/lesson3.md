# Lesson 3: The Koreas

## The Big Idea
Though they share a common history and culture, the two Koreas have very different governments and economies.

## Main Ideas
- Korea was one state with a shared history until the Korean War.
- Korean culture reflects its long history, and traditions continue into today.
- The people of South Korea today have freedom and economic opportunities.
- The people of North Korea today have little freedom or economic opportunity.

## If YOU lived there...
You live in Inchon, one of South Korea's largest cities. Sometimes your grandparents tell you about the other family members who still live in North Korea. You have never met them, of course, and your grandparents have not seen them since they were children, more than 50 years ago. After hearing stories about these family members, you are curious about their lives.

## History
Throughout its early history, Korea was ruled by several different kingdoms. The first may have been the Gojoseon kingdom. This kingdom fell to Han China in 108 BC. Later, three powerful kingdoms competed for control of Korea. Eventually the kingdom of Silla unified the Three Kingdoms and ruled Korea.

Silla rulers fought against China for many years. During this time, Chinese culture influenced Korea. Buddhism, Confucianism, and the Chinese writing system were all adopted in Korea.

### Foreign Rule
In the early 1900s, Japan took control of Korea. Japan had defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and as part of the peace settlement, Russia acknowledged Japan's interests in Korea. In 1910, Japan formally annexed Korea, making it a Japanese colony.

Japanese rule was harsh. The Japanese tried to eliminate Korean culture and force Koreans to adopt Japanese customs. They banned the Korean language in schools and government, and they forced Koreans to take Japanese names. They also exploited Korea's resources and used Korean workers for their industries.

During World War II, many Koreans were forced to work in Japanese factories and mines. Some Korean women were forced to serve as "comfort women" for Japanese soldiers, a historical issue that continues to cause tension between South Korea and Japan.

### Division and War
After Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945, Korea was divided at the 38th parallel. The Soviet Union occupied the northern part, while the United States occupied the south. The division was intended to be temporary, but as Cold War tensions increased, it became permanent.

In 1948, separate governments were established in the two parts of Korea. In the north, a communist government was established under Kim Il Sung, with support from the Soviet Union. In the south, a non-communist government was established under Syngman Rhee, with support from the United States.

On June 25, 1950, North Korean forces invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War. The United Nations, led by the United States, sent troops to defend South Korea. Later, China entered the war on North Korea's side.

The war lasted for three years and caused immense destruction and loss of life. It ended with an armistice (cease-fire) in 1953, but no peace treaty was ever signed. The border between North and South Korea was set near the 38th parallel, with a demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating the two countries.

### After the War
Since the Korean War, North and South Korea have developed in very different ways. North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has been ruled by the Kim family dynasty. Kim Il Sung ruled until his death in 1994, when he was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Il. After Kim Jong Il's death in 2011, his son, Kim Jong Un, took power.

North Korea has a communist system with a command economy, in which the government controls most economic activity. It has pursued a policy of self-reliance (juche) and has been largely isolated from the international community.

South Korea, officially known as the Republic of Korea, has had a more turbulent political history but has gradually developed into a stable democracy. After the authoritarian rule of Syngman Rhee and several military governments, South Korea held its first free presidential election in 1987.

South Korea has a capitalist economy and has pursued export-oriented industrialization. It has become one of the world's most advanced economies, known for its electronics, automobiles, and shipbuilding industries.

Relations between North and South Korea have been tense, with occasional periods of improved relations. There have been several summit meetings between the leaders of the two countries, most recently in 2018 and 2019, but significant differences remain.

## Culture
Despite the political division, North and South Korea share a common cultural heritage. Korean culture has been influenced by China but has developed its own unique characteristics.

### Language and Religion
The Korean language is spoken in both North and South Korea, though there are some differences in vocabulary and pronunciation due to the decades of separation. Korean has its own alphabet, called Hangul, which was created in the 15th century under King Sejong the Great. Before that, Koreans used Chinese characters.

Religion in Korea includes elements of Buddhism, Confucianism, and shamanism (belief in spirits and spiritual healers). Christianity has also become significant in South Korea, with about 30 percent of the population being Christian. North Korea, in contrast, is officially atheist, though traditional beliefs persist.

### Arts and Literature
Korean arts include ceramics, calligraphy, and painting. Korean ceramics, particularly celadon (a type of pottery with a pale green glaze), are renowned for their beauty. Traditional Korean painting often depicts landscapes, plants, and animals, and is influenced by Chinese painting styles but has its own distinctive characteristics.

Korean literature has a long history, with poetry being particularly important. Sijo is a traditional form of Korean poetry with a specific structure. Modern Korean literature includes novels, short stories, and poetry that often reflect Korea's historical experiences and social changes.

### Food and Customs
Korean cuisine is known for its bold flavors and use of fermented foods. Kimchi, a spicy fermented vegetable dish, is a staple of Korean meals. Other popular dishes include bulgogi (marinated grilled beef), bibimbap (rice with vegetables and meat), and various stews and soups.

Traditional Korean customs emphasize respect for elders, family ties, and group harmony. These values are influenced by Confucianism, which teaches proper relationships between people based on age, gender, and social status.

Traditional Korean clothing, called hanbok, consists of a jeogori (jacket) and a chima (skirt) for women, and a jeogori and baji (pants) for men. While hanbok is now worn mainly for special occasions, it remains an important symbol of Korean culture.

## South Korea Today
South Korea has transformed from a poor, agricultural country in the 1950s to one of the world's most advanced economies. It is known for its technological innovation, vibrant democracy, and global cultural influence.

### Government and Politics
South Korea is a democratic republic with a presidential system. The president is elected directly by the people for a single five-year term and serves as both head of state and head of government. The National Assembly is the legislative body, with members elected for four-year terms.

South Korea has a multi-party system, though politics has traditionally been dominated by two main parties: a conservative party and a liberal party (the names of these parties have changed over time). Political debates often focus on economic policies, relations with North Korea, and social issues.

South Korea has a free press, active civil society, and protection for civil liberties. It has made significant progress in addressing corruption and improving transparency in government and business.

### Economy
South Korea's economy is one of the largest in the world. It is known for its export-oriented industries, particularly electronics, automobiles, shipbuilding, and steel. Major South Korean companies, such as Samsung, Hyundai, and LG, are global brands.

South Korea's economic development, often called the "Miracle on the Han River," was achieved through a combination of government planning, investment in education, and hard work. The government initially focused on labor-intensive industries such as textiles, then moved to heavy industries like steel and shipbuilding, and finally to high-tech industries like electronics and information technology.

South Korea has a highly educated workforce. Education is highly valued in Korean society, and competition for admission to top universities is intense. The country has one of the highest rates of university attendance in the world.

Despite its economic success, South Korea faces challenges such as income inequality, an aging population, and dependence on exports. The government has been working to address these issues through various policies and reforms.

### Society and Daily Life
South Korean society is a blend of traditional values and modern lifestyles. Family remains important, but traditional family structures are changing. More women are pursuing education and careers, and the birth rate has declined significantly.

South Korea is highly urbanized, with about 80 percent of the population living in cities. Seoul, the capital, is a megacity with about 10 million people in the city proper and about 25 million in the metropolitan area. It is known for its efficient public transportation, high-rise buildings, and vibrant neighborhoods.

Technology is a major part of daily life in South Korea. The country has one of the world's highest rates of internet usage and smartphone ownership. It is a leader in 5G technology and has a thriving digital culture.

South Korean popular culture, known as the "Korean Wave" or "Hallyu," has gained international popularity. K-pop (Korean pop music), Korean dramas, and Korean films have fans around the world. The film "Parasite," directed by Bong Joon-ho, made history in 2020 as the first non-English language film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.

## North Korea Today
North Korea is one of the world's most isolated and repressive countries. It is known for its authoritarian government, struggling economy, and nuclear weapons program.

### Government and Politics
North Korea is a one-party state ruled by the Korean Workers' Party. The country's leader, Kim Jong Un, holds the titles of Chairman of the State Affairs Commission, Chairman of the Korean Workers' Party, and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army.

North Korea's political system is based on the ideology of Juche (self-reliance) and the principle of "military first" (Songun). The regime maintains control through a combination of propaganda, surveillance, and harsh punishment for dissent.

North Korea has been described as a totalitarian state, with severe restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, and religion. There is no independent media, and access to foreign information is strictly controlled. The government maintains a personality cult around the Kim family, portraying them as godlike figures.

### Economy
North Korea has a centrally planned economy, with most industries owned and controlled by the state. The economy has faced severe difficulties since the 1990s, when the collapse of the Soviet Union ended the subsidies that had supported North Korea.

In the mid-1990s, North Korea experienced a severe famine, known as the "Arduous March," which resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths. The country continues to face food shortages and relies on international aid to feed its population.

North Korea's economic challenges have been exacerbated by international sanctions imposed in response to its nuclear weapons program. These sanctions restrict North Korea's trade and access to foreign currency.

In recent years, there have been some limited market-oriented reforms, with the government allowing some private enterprise and markets. However, the economy remains heavily controlled by the state and is one of the poorest in Asia.

### Society and Daily Life
Daily life in North Korea is characterized by hardship and strict control. Most North Koreans have limited access to electricity, heating, and clean water. Food shortages are common, and malnutrition is a serious problem.

The government controls most aspects of daily life. North Koreans are assigned jobs and housing by the state. Travel within the country is restricted, and leaving the country without permission is illegal.

Education in North Korea is free and compulsory, but it is heavily focused on political indoctrination. Students spend a significant amount of time studying the teachings and achievements of the Kim family.

Information about daily life in North Korea is limited due to the country's isolation and restrictions on foreign media. However, reports from defectors and the few foreigners allowed to visit paint a picture of a society with limited freedoms and significant economic challenges.

## Relations Between the Koreas
Relations between North and South Korea have been characterized by tension and occasional conflict, with periods of attempted reconciliation.

### Military Tensions
The Korean Peninsula remains one of the world's most militarized regions. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea is heavily fortified, with troops on both sides. There have been occasional military clashes, including naval incidents and artillery exchanges.

North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles has increased tensions on the peninsula and in the region. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006 and has conducted several more since then. It has also tested various types of missiles, including some capable of reaching the United States.

### Diplomatic Efforts
Despite the tensions, there have been efforts at reconciliation. In 2000, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang, the first summit between leaders of the two Koreas. This "Sunshine Policy" of engagement led to increased economic cooperation and family reunions.

Relations deteriorated in the late 2000s and early 2010s due to North Korea's nuclear tests and other provocations. However, in 2018, there was a thaw in relations. South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held three summit meetings, and Kim Jong Un also met with U.S. President Donald Trump.

These diplomatic efforts have not yet led to significant changes in North Korea's nuclear program or the overall relationship between the two Koreas. The future of inter-Korean relations remains uncertain, with both challenges and opportunities for reconciliation.

### Reunification Prospects
The goal of reunification is officially supported by both Korean governments, though they have different visions of what a unified Korea would look like. South Korea envisions a gradual process leading to a democratic, market-oriented unified state. North Korea's vision involves a confederation that would preserve its political system.

The practical challenges of reunification are enormous. The economic disparity between North and South Korea is much greater than that between East and West Germany before German reunification. The cost of integrating North Korea's economy and infrastructure with South Korea's would be immense.

There are also social and cultural challenges. After more than 70 years of separation, the two societies have developed differently. North Koreans would need to adapt to a democratic, capitalist society, while South Koreans would need to accept the economic burden of reunification.

Despite these challenges, many Koreans, especially older generations with memories of a unified Korea, continue to hope for eventual reunification. Whether and how this might occur remains one of the great questions of East Asian politics.
