# Lesson 1: Physical Geography

## The Big Idea
Japan and the Koreas are rugged, mountainous areas surrounded by water.

## Main Ideas
- The main physical features of Japan and the Koreas are rugged mountains.
- The climates and resources of Japan and the Koreas vary from north to south.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a passenger on a very fast train zipping its way across the countryside. If you look out the window to your right, you can see the distant sparkle of sunlight on the ocean. If you look to the left, you see rocky, rugged mountains. Suddenly the train leaves the mountains, and you see hundreds of trees covered in delicate pink flowers. Rising above the trees is a single snowcapped volcano.

## Physical Features
Japan, North Korea, and South Korea are on the eastern edge of the Asian continent, just east of China. Separated from each other only by a narrow strait, Japan and the Koreas share many common landscape features.

### Physical Features of Japan
Japan is an island country. It consists of four main islands—Hokkaido (hoh-KY-doh), Honshu (HAHN-shoo), Shikoku (shee-KOH-koo), and Kyushu (KYOO-shoo)—and thousands of smaller islands. The islands of Japan stretch for about 1,500 miles (2,400 km) from northeast to southwest.

Japan is a mountainous country. About 80 percent of its land is covered by mountains. Many of these mountains are actually volcanoes. Japan has about 200 volcanoes, of which about 60 are active.

Japan's most famous volcano is **Fuji** (FOO-jee), or Mount Fuji. At 12,388 feet (3,776 m), it is Japan's highest mountain. Fuji is a sacred mountain in Japanese culture and has been featured in countless works of art. Although Fuji has not erupted since 1707, it is still considered an active volcano.

Japan's mountains leave little flat land for farming or settlement. Most of Japan's people live on narrow coastal plains. These plains make up only about 20 percent of Japan's land area.

Japan's location along the Pacific Ring of Fire makes it prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The Ring of Fire is a zone of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that encircles the Pacific Ocean. Japan experiences thousands of earthquakes each year, though most are too small to cause damage.

### Physical Features of the Koreas
North Korea and South Korea occupy the **Korean Peninsula**, which extends southward from the Asian mainland. The peninsula is about 600 miles (966 km) long and is surrounded by water on three sides. The Yellow Sea lies to the west, and the Sea of Japan (also called the East Sea) lies to the east. The Korea Strait separates the peninsula from Japan.

Like Japan, the Korean Peninsula is mostly mountainous. Mountains cover about 70 percent of the peninsula. The highest mountains are in the north, near the border with China. The highest peak is Mount Paektu, an active volcano that rises to 9,003 feet (2,744 m).

The mountains of the Korean Peninsula generally run from north to south. Between the mountain ranges are narrow valleys and small plains. The largest lowland area is along the west coast. This region has the peninsula's best farmland.

The Korean Peninsula has many rivers, most of which flow from the mountains to the sea. The longest river is the Amnok (Yalu), which forms part of the border between North Korea and China. Other major rivers include the Tumen, which also forms part of the North Korea-China border, and the Han, which flows through Seoul, South Korea's capital.

## Climate and Resources
The climates and resources of Japan and the Koreas vary from north to south. Both regions have distinct seasons and a variety of natural resources.

### Climate of Japan
Japan's climate varies from north to south. The northern island of Hokkaido has cold winters with heavy snowfall and mild summers. The southern islands have milder winters and hot, humid summers.

Japan's climate is strongly influenced by seasonal winds called monsoons. Winter monsoons bring cold, dry air from the Asian mainland. Summer monsoons bring warm, moist air from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in heavy rainfall.

Japan also experiences typhoons, powerful tropical storms with strong winds and heavy rain. Typhoons typically occur in late summer and early fall. They can cause significant damage through high winds, flooding, and landslides.

Another natural hazard in Japan is **tsunamis**. Tsunamis are giant ocean waves caused by underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. They can travel across the ocean at high speeds and cause devastating damage when they hit land. In March 2011, a massive earthquake off Japan's northeast coast triggered a tsunami that killed thousands of people and caused a nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant.

### Climate of the Koreas
The Korean Peninsula has a continental climate with four distinct seasons. Winters are cold and dry, while summers are hot and humid. Spring and fall are generally mild and pleasant.

Like Japan, the Koreas are affected by monsoon winds. Summer monsoons bring heavy rainfall, particularly in July and August. Winter monsoons bring cold, dry air from Siberia.

The northern part of the peninsula, which includes most of North Korea, has colder winters and cooler summers than the south. The southern part, which includes most of South Korea, has milder winters and hotter summers.

The Korean Peninsula is less prone to earthquakes than Japan, but it does experience typhoons, particularly in the south. These storms can cause flooding and landslides.

### Natural Resources of Japan
Japan has limited natural resources. It has some coal, but few other mineral resources. It must import most of the raw materials needed for its industries, including oil, natural gas, and most metals.

One of Japan's most important natural resources is its forests, which cover about 67 percent of the country. These forests provide timber for construction and paper production.

Japan also has abundant water resources, including many rivers with potential for hydroelectric power generation. However, most of Japan's rivers are short and swift, making them less useful for transportation.

Perhaps Japan's most valuable natural resource is its surrounding seas. Japan has one of the world's largest **fisheries**. Fish and seafood are important parts of the Japanese diet. However, overfishing has depleted some fish stocks in recent years.

### Natural Resources of the Koreas
The Korean Peninsula has more mineral resources than Japan, particularly in the north. North Korea has deposits of coal, iron ore, gold, zinc, copper, and lead. It also has significant hydroelectric power potential due to its mountainous terrain and numerous rivers.

South Korea has fewer mineral resources than North Korea. It has some coal and small amounts of other minerals, but it must import most of the raw materials for its industries.

Like Japan, both Koreas have valuable forest resources, though much of North Korea's forests have been depleted due to excessive logging and the need for firewood. Both countries also have important fisheries in the surrounding seas.

## Environmental Challenges
Japan and the Koreas face various environmental challenges, including pollution, deforestation, and the impacts of natural disasters.

### Environmental Challenges in Japan
Japan's rapid industrialization after World War II led to severe pollution problems in the 1960s and 1970s. Air pollution from factories caused respiratory diseases, and industrial waste contaminated rivers and coastal waters.

Since then, Japan has implemented strict environmental regulations and has made significant progress in reducing pollution. However, air pollution remains a concern in major cities, and some rivers and coastal areas are still polluted.

Japan's dense population and limited land area create pressure on natural habitats. Many of Japan's native plant and animal species are threatened by habitat loss and the introduction of non-native species.

The 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused a major environmental disaster when they damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, leading to the release of radioactive materials. The cleanup and decontamination efforts are expected to take decades.

### Environmental Challenges in the Koreas
North Korea faces severe environmental problems, including deforestation, soil erosion, and water pollution. Deforestation has been caused by the clearing of land for agriculture and the cutting of trees for fuel. This has led to soil erosion and increased the risk of flooding.

North Korea's industrial facilities, many of which use outdated technology, release untreated pollutants into the air and water. The country lacks the resources to implement effective environmental protection measures.

South Korea, like Japan, experienced severe pollution during its rapid industrialization. It has since implemented environmental regulations and has made progress in reducing pollution. However, air pollution remains a significant problem, particularly in Seoul and other major cities.

Both Koreas face challenges related to climate change, including the potential for more frequent and severe typhoons, changes in precipitation patterns, and rising sea levels.
