# Lesson 5: Geography Handbook

## The Big Idea
Geographers study the world by understanding maps and geographic features of Earth.

## Main Ideas
- When creating maps, cartographers use a pattern of latitude and longitude lines that circle Earth.
- Cartographers have created map projections to show the round surface of Earth on a flat piece of paper.
- Cartographers provide features to help users read maps.
- There are different kinds of maps for different uses.
- There are many kinds of landforms and other features on Earth.

## Key Terms and Places
- **grid**: a pattern of imaginary lines that circle the globe in east-west and north-south directions
- **latitude**: east-west lines in the grid; also called parallels
- **parallels**: lines of latitude that are always the same distance apart
- **equator**: an imaginary line that circles the globe halfway between the North and South Poles
- **degrees**: units used to measure distance from the equator in lines of latitude
- **minutes**: smaller units of measurement; there are 60 minutes in a degree
- **longitude**: north-south imaginary lines called meridians
- **meridians**: lines of longitude that pass through the poles
- **prime meridian**: an imaginary line that divides the globe into east and west halves
- **hemispheres**: the halves of Earth divided by the equator and prime meridian
- **continents**: Earth's seven large landmasses
- **map projections**: different ways of showing our round planet on flat maps

## Latitude and Longitude

As you learned in Lesson 4, a globe is a spherical model of Earth. It is useful for showing the entire Earth or studying large areas of Earth's surface.

To study the world, geographers use a pattern of imaginary lines that circle the globe in east–west and north–south directions. It is called a grid. The intersection of these imaginary lines helps us find places on Earth.

The east–west lines in the grid are lines of latitude. These lines are called parallels because they are always the same distance apart. Lines of latitude measure distance north and south of the equator. The equator is an imaginary line that circles the globe halfway between the North and South Poles. It divides the globe into north and south halves. Parallels measure distance from the equator in degrees. The symbol for degrees is °. Degrees are further divided into minutes. The symbol for minutes is ′. There are 60 minutes in a degree. Parallels north of the equator are labeled with an N. Those south of the equator are labeled with an S.

The north–south imaginary lines are lines of longitude. Lines of longitude are called meridians. These imaginary lines pass through the poles. They measure distance east and west of the prime meridian. The prime meridian is an imaginary line that divides the globe into east and west halves. It runs through Greenwich, England, and represents 0° longitude.

Lines of latitude range from 0°, for locations on the equator, to 90°N or 90°S, for locations at the poles. Lines of longitude range from 0° on the prime meridian to 180° on a meridian in the mid–Pacific Ocean. Meridians west of the prime meridian to 180° are labeled with a W. Those east of the prime meridian to 180° are labeled with an E. Using latitude and longitude, geographers can identify the exact location of any place on Earth.

The equator divides the globe into two halves, called hemispheres. The half north of the equator is the Northern Hemisphere. The southern half is the Southern Hemisphere. The prime meridian and the 180° meridian divide the world into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres.

Earth's land surface is divided into seven large landmasses that are called continents. Landmasses smaller than continents and completely surrounded by water are called islands.

Geographers organize Earth's water surface into major regions, too. The largest is the world ocean. Geographers divide the world ocean into the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Southern Ocean.

## Map Projections

A map is a flat diagram of all or part of Earth's surface. Mapmakers have created different ways of showing our round planet on flat maps. These different ways are called map projections. Because Earth is round, there is no way to show it accurately on a flat map. All flat maps are distorted in some way. Mapmakers must choose the type of map projection that is best for their purposes. Many map projections are one of three kinds: cylindrical, conic, or flat-plane.

### Cylindrical Projections

These projections are based on a cylinder wrapped around the globe. The cylinder touches the globe only at the equator. The meridians are pulled apart and are parallel to each other instead of meeting at the poles. This causes landmasses near the poles to appear larger than they really are.

A Mercator projection is one type of cylindrical projection. The Mercator projection is useful for navigators because it shows true direction and shape. However, it distorts the size of land areas near the poles.

### Conic Projections

These projections are based on a cone placed over the globe. A conic projection is most accurate along the lines of latitude where it touches the globe. It retains almost true shape and size. Conic projections are most useful for showing areas that have long east–west dimensions, such as the United States.

### Flat-plane Projections

These projections are based on a plane touching the globe at one point, such as at the North Pole or South Pole. A flat-plane projection can show true direction to airplane pilots and ship navigators. It also shows true area. However, it distorts the true shapes of landmasses.

## Map Features

Maps are like messages sent out in code. To help us translate the code, mapmakers provide certain features. These features help us understand the message they are presenting about a particular part of the world. Of these features, almost all maps have a title, a compass rose, a scale, and a legend. Some maps also include a locator map.

### 1. Title

A map's title shows what the subject of the map is. The map title is usually the first thing you should look at when studying a map, because it tells you what the map is trying to show.

### 2. Compass Rose

A directional indicator shows which way north, south, east, and west lie on the map. Some mapmakers use a "north arrow," which points toward the North Pole. Remember, "north" is not always at the top of a map. The way a map is drawn and the location of directions on that map depend on the perspective of the mapmaker. Most maps indicate direction with a compass rose. A compass rose has arrows that point to all four principal directions, also called cardinal points. The principal directions are north (N), east (E), south (S), and west (W). Some compass roses also show the intermediate directions. These are northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW).

### 3. Scale

Mapmakers use scales to represent the distances between points on a map. Scales may appear on maps in several different forms. Some maps provide a bar scale. Scales give distances in miles and kilometers.

To find the distance between two points on the map, place a piece of paper so that the edge connects the two points. Mark the location of each point on the paper with a line or dot. Then compare the distance between the two dots with the map's bar scale. The number on the top of the scale gives the distance in miles. The number on the bottom gives the distance in kilometers. Because the distances are given in large intervals, you may have to approximate the actual distance on the scale.

### 4. Legend

The legend, or key, explains what the symbols on the map represent. Point symbols are used to specify the location of things, such as cities, that do not take up much space on the map. Some legends show colors that represent certain features like empires or other regions. Other maps might have legends with symbols or colors that represent features such as roads. Legends can also show economic resources, land use, population density, and climate. Some legends include the map scale as well.

### 5. Locator Map

A locator map shows where in the world the area on the map is located. The area shown on the main map is shown in red on the locator map. The locator map also shows surrounding areas so the reader can see how the information on the map relates to neighboring lands.

## Different Kinds of Maps

As you study the world's regions and countries, you will use a variety of maps. Political maps and physical maps are two of the most common types of maps you will study. In addition, you will use thematic maps. These maps might show climate, population, resources, ancient empires, or other topics. By working with these maps, you will see what the physical geography of places is like, where people live, and how the world has changed over time.

### Political Maps

Political maps show the major political features of a region. These features include country borders, capital cities, and other places. Political maps use different colors to represent countries, and capital cities are often shown with a special star symbol.

### Physical Maps

Physical maps show the major physical features of a region. These features may include mountain ranges, rivers, oceans, islands, deserts, and plains. Often, these maps use different colors to represent different elevations of land. The reader can easily see which areas are high elevations, such as mountains, and which areas are lower.

### Thematic Maps

Thematic maps focus on one special topic, such as climate, resources, or population. These maps present information on the topic that is particularly important in the region. Depending on the type of thematic map, the information may be shown with different colors, arrows, dots, or other symbols.

## Earth's Surface Features
