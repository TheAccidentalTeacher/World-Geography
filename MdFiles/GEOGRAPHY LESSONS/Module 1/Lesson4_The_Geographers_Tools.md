# Lesson 4: The Geographer's Tools

## The Big Idea
Geographers use many tools to study the world.

## Main Ideas
- Maps and globes are the most commonly used tools of geographers.
- Many geographers study information gathered by satellites.
- Geographers use many other tools, including graphs, charts, databases, and models, in their work.

## Key Terms and Places
- **map**: a flat drawing that shows all or part of Earth's surface
- **globe**: a spherical, or ball-shaped, model of the entire planet
- **Global Positioning System (GPS)**: a system that uses 24 satellites to transmit information to Earth, giving the exact location of a given object on our planet
- **Geographic Information System (GIS)**: a geography tool made up of a group of databases that combines and provides information from many different sources

## Maps and Globes

Like all people with jobs to do, geographers need tools to study the world. The tools that geographers use most often in their work are maps and globes. A map is a flat drawing that shows all or part of Earth's surface. A globe is a spherical, or ball-shaped, model of the entire planet.

Both maps and globes show what the world looks like. They can show where mountains, deserts, and oceans are. They can also identify and describe the world's countries and major cities.

There are, however, major differences between maps and globes. Because a globe is spherical like Earth, it can show the world as it really is. A map, though, is flat. It is not possible to show a spherical area perfectly on a flat surface. To understand what this means, think about an orange. If you took the peel off of an orange, could you make it lie completely flat? No, you could not, unless you stretched or tore the peel first.

The same principle is true with maps. To draw Earth on a flat surface, people have to distort, or alter, some details. For example, places on a map might look to be farther apart than they really are, or their shapes or sizes might be changed slightly.

Still, maps have many advantages over globes. Flat maps are easier to work with than globes. Also, it is easier to show small areas like cities on maps than on globes. In addition, maps usually show more information than globes. Because globes are more expensive to make, they do not usually show anything more than where places are and what features they have.

Maps, on the other hand, can show all sorts of information. Besides showing land use and cities, maps can include a great deal of information about a place. A map might show what languages people speak or where their ancestors came from. Maps can even show how many students in an area play soccer.

## Satellites

Maps and globes are not the only tools that geographers use in their work. As you have already read, many geographers study information gathered by satellites.

Much of the information gathered by these satellites is in the form of images. Geographers can study these images of Earth to see what an area looks like from far above. Satellites also collect information that we cannot see from the planet's surface. The information gathered by satellites helps geographers make accurate maps.

Satellites also collect and transmit information for a technology called Global Positioning System (GPS). The system uses 24 satellites to transmit information to Earth. This GPS information gives the exact location of a given object on our planet. The information is displayed on a small receiver. Vehicle drivers are some of the people who use GPS to find out how to get from where they are to other locations. There are many other uses of GPS. These include locating people in need of rescue on boats or in the wilderness. Scientists also use GPS to track and study wildlife.

## Other Geographic Tools

Geographers also use many other tools. To depict aspects of various countries and world regions, geographers create graphs, charts, databases, and models. They also use these tools to gather data and compare various world regions.

There is a geography tool that is made up of a group of databases. It is called Geographic Information System (GIS). GIS combines and provides information from many different sources. People use GIS by posing questions to the system. For example, a city planner might be looking for the best site near a city to build an airport. To find out, a geographer asks GIS, "What geographic characteristics are important for a good airport site?" GIS pulls together many layers of information, including different types of maps, to answer the question.

In less complex cases, the best tools a geographer can use are a notebook and digital voice recorder to take notes while talking to people. Armed with the proper tools, geographers learn about the world's people and places.

## Summary

You have learned that geographers use maps, globes, and other tools to study the world. Maps and globes show what the world looks like, but maps can show more detailed information. Satellites gather information that helps geographers make accurate maps and understand Earth better. GPS uses satellites to give exact locations on Earth. GIS combines information from many sources to help answer geographic questions. Geographers also use graphs, charts, and other tools to study the world.

## Assessment

### Review Ideas, Terms, and Places
1. a. Compare and Contrast: How are maps and globes similar? How are they different?
   b. Identify: What are the advantages maps have over globes?
2. a. Describe: How do geographers use satellite images?
   b. Recall: What are some uses of GPS?
3. a. Describe: What is GIS?
   b. Recall: What is the purpose of GIS for geographers?

### Critical Thinking
4. Summarize: Make a chart that lists some of the geographer's tools.
