# Lesson 2: The Branches of Geography

## The Big Idea
Geography is divided into two main branches—physical geography and human geography.

## Main Ideas
- Physical geography is the study of landforms, water bodies, and other physical features.
- Human geography focuses on people, their cultures, and the landscapes they create.
- Other branches of geography examine specific aspects of the physical or human world.

## Key Terms and Places
- **physical geography**: the study of the world's physical geographic features—its landforms, bodies of water, climates, soils, and plants
- **human geography**: the study of the world's human geographic features—people, communities, and landscapes
- **cartography**: the science of making maps
- **meteorology**: the study of weather and what causes it

## Physical Geography

Think about a jigsaw puzzle. Seen as a whole, the puzzle shows a pretty or interesting picture. To see that picture, though, you have to put all the puzzle pieces together. Before you assemble them, the pieces do not give you a clear idea of what the puzzle will look like when it is assembled. After all, each piece contains only a tiny portion of the overall image.

In many ways, geography is like a huge puzzle. It is made up of many branches, or divisions. Each of these branches focuses on a single part of the world. Viewed separately, none of these branches shows us the whole world. Together, however, the many branches of geography improve our understanding of our planet and its people.

Geography's two main branches are physical geography and human geography. Geographers identify and locate major physical and human geographic features of various places and regions in the world. The first branch, physical geography, is the study of the world's physical geographic features—its landforms, bodies of water, climates, soils, and plants.

### The Physical World

What does it mean to say that physical geography is the study of physical geographic features? Physical geographers want to know all about the different features found on our planet. They want to know where mountain ranges are, how rivers flow across the landscape, and why different amounts of rain fall from place to place.

More importantly, however, physical geographers want to know what causes the different shapes on Earth. They want to know why mountain ranges rise up where they do and what causes rivers to flow in certain directions. They also want to know why various parts of the world have very different weather and climate patterns.

To answer these questions, physical geographers take detailed measurements. They study the heights of mountains and the temperatures of places. To track any changes that occur over time, physical geographers keep careful records of all the information they collect.

### Uses of Physical Geography

Earth is made up of hundreds of types of physical geographic features. Without a complete understanding of what these features are and the effect they have on the world's people and landscapes, we cannot fully understand our world. This is the major reason that geographers study the physical world—to learn how it works.

There are also other, more specific reasons for studying physical geography, though. Studying the changes that take place on our planet can help us prepare to live with those changes. For example, knowing what causes volcanoes to erupt can help us predict eruptions. Knowing what causes terrible storms can help us prepare for them. In this way, the work of physical geographers helps us adjust to the dangers and changes of our world.

## Human Geography

The physical world is only one part of the puzzle of geography. People are also part of the world. Human geography is the study of the world's human geographic features—people, communities, and landscapes. It is the second major branch of geography.

### The Human World

Put simply, human geographers study the world's people, past and present. They look at where people live and why. They ask why some parts of the world have more people than others, and why some places have almost no people at all.

Human geographers also study what people do. What jobs do people have? What crops do they grow? What makes them move from place to place? These are the types of questions that geographers ask about people around the world.

Because people's lives are so different in different places, no one can study every aspect of human geography. As a result, human geographers often specialize in a smaller area of study. Some may choose to study only the people and landscapes in a certain region. For example, a geographer may study only the lives of people who live in West Africa.

Other geographers choose not to limit their studies to one place. Instead, they may choose to examine only one aspect of people's lives. For example, a geographer could study only economics, politics, or city life. However, that geographer may compare economic patterns in various parts of the world to see how they differ.

### Uses of Human Geography

Although every culture is different, people around the world have some common needs. All people need food and water. All people need shelter. All people need to deal with other people in order to survive.

Human geographers study how people in various places address their needs. They look at the foods people eat and the types of governments they form. The knowledge they gather can help us better understand people in other cultures. Sometimes, this type of understanding can help people improve their landscapes and situations.

On a smaller scale, human geographers can help people design their cities and towns. By understanding where people go and what they need, geographers can help city planners place roads, shopping malls, and schools. Geographers also study the effect people have on the world. As a result, they often work with private groups and government agencies that want to protect the environment.

### Partnering with Archaeology and History

Human geography can also help other types of social scientists, such as archaeologists. Archaeologists engage in digs and study artifacts and features in a particular location. They gather evidence about groups of people and how those groups lived at particular times in history. The human geography of a place is part of archaeologists' gathered evidence.

Human geography also contributes to the work of historians. Historians use archaeological, geographical, and other types of evidence to investigate patterns in history. They identify turning points. A turning point can be an event, era, or development in history that brought about social, cultural, ecological, political, or economic change. The geography of places can affect historic turning points.

## Other Fields of Geography

Physical geography and human geography are the two largest branches of the subject, but they are not the only ones. Many other fields of geography exist, each one devoted to studying one aspect of the world.

Most of these fields are smaller, more specialized areas of either physical or human geography. For example, economic geography—the study of how people make and spend money—is a branch of human geography. Another specialized branch of human geography is urban geography, the study of cities and how people live in them. Physical geography also includes many fields, such as the study of climates. Other fields of physical geography are the studies of soils and plants.

### Cartography

One key field of geography is cartography, the science of making maps. Without maps, geographers would not be able to study where things are in the world. In addition to locations, maps can display other information about people, places, and environments. Cartographers decide which information to include on a given map and how it is displayed.

In the past, cartographers always drew maps by hand. Many of those maps were not very accurate. Today, though, most maps are made using computers and satellite images. Through advances in mapmaking, we can make accurate maps on almost any scale, from the whole world to a single neighborhood, and keep them up to date. These maps are not only used by geographers. For example, road maps are used by people who are planning long trips.

### Hydrology

Another important branch of geography is hydrology, the study of water on Earth. Geographers in this field study the world's river systems and rainfall patterns. They study what causes droughts and floods and how people in cities can get safe drinking water. They also work to measure and protect the world's supply of water.

### Meteorology

Have you ever seen the weather report on television? If so, you have seen the results of another branch of geography. This branch is called meteorology, the study of weather and what causes it. Meteorologists use computers to follow and predict weather.

Meteorologists study weather patterns in a particular area. Then they use the information to predict what the weather will be like in the coming days. Their work helps people plan what to wear and what to do on any given day. It can also help people prepare for dangerous weather, such as hurricanes and tornadoes.

## Summary

Geography is divided into two main branches—physical geography and human geography. Physical geography is the study of landforms, water bodies, and other physical features. Human geography focuses on people, their cultures, and the landscapes they create. Other branches of geography examine specific aspects of the physical or human world.
