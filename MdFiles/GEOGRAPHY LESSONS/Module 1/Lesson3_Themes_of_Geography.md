# Lesson 3: Themes of Geography

## The Big Idea
Geographers have created two different but related systems for organizing geographic studies.

## Main Ideas
- The five themes of geography help us organize our studies of the world.
- The six essential elements of geography highlight some of the subject's most important ideas.

## Key Terms and Places
- **absolute location**: a specific description of where a place is, such as an address
- **relative location**: a general description of where a place lies in relation to other places
- **environment**: the land, water, climate, plants, and animals of an area

## The Five Themes of Geography

Geographers use themes, or ideas, in their work. These geography themes can be applied to nearly everything that geographers study. The five major themes of geography are Location, Place, Human-Environment Interaction, Movement, and Regions.

### Location

Every point on Earth has a location, a description of where it is. This location can be expressed in many ways. Sometimes a site's location is expressed in specific, or absolute, terms, such as an address. For example, the White House is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in the city of Washington, DC. A specific description like this one is called an absolute location.

Other times, the site's location is expressed in general terms. For example, Canada is north of the United States. This general description of where a place lies is called its relative location.

### Place

Another theme, Place, is closely related to Location. However, Place does not refer simply to where an area is. It refers to the area's landscape, the features that define the area and make it different from other places. Such features could include land, climate, and people. Together, they give a place its own character.

### Human-Environment Interaction

In addition to looking at the features of places, geographers examine how those features interact. In particular, they want to understand how people interact with their environment—how people and their physical environment affect each other. An area's environment includes its land, water, climate, plants, and animals.

People interact with their environment every day in all sorts of ways. They clear forests to plant crops, level fields to build cities, and dam rivers to prevent floods. At the same time, physical environments affect how people live. People in cold areas, for example, build houses with thick walls and wear heavy clothing to keep warm. People who live near oceans look for ways to protect themselves from storms.

### Movement

People are constantly moving. They move within cities, between cities, and between countries. Geographers want to know why and how people move. For example, they ask if people are moving to find work or to live in a more pleasant area. Geographers also study the roads and routes that make movement so common.

### Regions

You have already learned how geographers divide the world into many regions to help the study of geography. Creating regions also makes it easier to compare places. Comparisons help geographers learn why each place has developed the way it has.

## The Six Essential Elements

The five themes of geography are not the only system geographers use to study the world. They also use a system of essential elements and national standards. Together, these themes, essential elements, and standards identify the most important ideas in the study of geography.

The geography standards are 18 basic ideas that are central to the study of geography. The essential elements are based on the geography standards and act as a bridge between the themes and standards. Each element links several standards together. The six essential elements are The World in Spatial Terms, Places and Regions, Physical Systems, Human Systems, Environment and Society, and The Uses of Geography.

Read through that list again. Do you see any similarities between geography's six essential elements and its five themes? You probably do. The two systems are very similar because the six essential elements build on the five themes.

For example, the element Places and Regions combines two of the five themes of geography—Place and Regions. Also, the element called Environment and Society is related to the theme of Human-Environment Interaction. The element The World in Spatial Terms is related to the theme of Location.

## Geography's Themes, Essential Elements, and Standards

### Themes of Geography
- **Location**: The theme of Location describes where something is.
- **Place**: Place describes the features that make a site unique.
- **Regions**: Regions are areas that share common characteristics.
- **Movement**: This theme looks at how and why people and things move.
- **Human-Environment Interaction**: People interact with their environment in many ways.

### Essential Elements
- **The World in Spatial Terms**
- **Places and Regions**
- **Physical Systems**
- **Human Systems**
- **Environment and Society**
- **The Uses of Geography**

### Geography Standards
1. How to use maps and other geographic representations, tools, and technologies to acquire, process, and report information from a spatial perspective
2. How to use mental maps to organize information about people, places, and environments in a spatial context
3. How to analyze the spatial organization of people, places, and environments on Earth's surface
4. The physical and human characteristics of places
5. How people create regions to interpret Earth's complexity
6. How culture and experience influence people's perceptions of places and regions
7. The physical processes that shape the patterns of Earth's surface
8. The characteristics and spatial distribution of ecosystems on Earth's surface
9. The characteristics, distribution, and migration of human populations on Earth's surface
10. The characteristics, distribution, and complexity of Earth's cultural mosaics
11. The patterns and networks of economic interdependence on Earth's surface
12. The processes, patterns, and functions of human settlement
13. How the forces of cooperation and conflict among people influence the division and control of Earth's surface
14. How human actions modify the physical environment
15. How physical systems affect human systems
16. Changes that occur in the meaning, use, distribution, and importance of resources
17. How to apply geography to interpret the past
18. How to apply geography to interpret the present and plan for the future

## Summary

Geographers use two systems to organize their studies: the five themes of geography and the six essential elements. The five themes are Location, Place, Human-Environment Interaction, Movement, and Regions. The six essential elements are The World in Spatial Terms, Places and Regions, Physical Systems, Human Systems, Environment and Society, and The Uses of Geography. These systems help geographers organize their work and understand the world better.

## Assessment

### Review Ideas, Terms, and Places
1. a. Contrast: How are the themes of Location and Place different?
   b. Elaborate: How does using the five themes help geographers understand the places they study?
2. a. Identify: Which of the five themes of geography is associated with airports, highways, and the migration of people from one place to another?
   b. Explain: How are the geography standards and the six essential elements related?
   c. Compare: How are the six essential elements similar to the five themes of geography?
   d. Recall: To which essential element does the theme of Location relate?

### Critical Thinking
3. Categorize: Draw a chart with three columns: Theme, Explanation, and Feature. List the five themes of geography, explain each of the themes, and list one feature of your city or town that relates to each.
