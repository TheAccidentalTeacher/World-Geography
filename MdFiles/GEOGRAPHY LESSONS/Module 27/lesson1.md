# Lesson 1: Physical Geography

## The Big Idea
The physical geography of the Indian Subcontinent includes unique physical features and a variety of climates and resources.

## Main Ideas
- Towering mountains, large rivers, and broad plains are the key physical features of the Indian Subcontinent.
- The Indian Subcontinent has a great variety of climate regions and resources.

## If YOU lived there...
You live in a small farming village in central India. Every year your father talks about the summer monsoons, winds that often bring heavy rains to the region. You know that too much rain could cause floods that may threaten your house and family. Too little rain could cause your crops to fail.

**How do you feel about the monsoons?**

## Physical Features
Locate Asia on a map of the world. Notice that the southernmost portion of Asia creates a triangular wedge of land that dips into the Indian Ocean. The piece of land jutting out from the rest of Asia is the Indian Subcontinent. A **subcontinent** is a large landmass that is smaller than a continent.

Use the map to locate the nations of the Indian Subcontinentâ€”Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. This region, also called South Asia, is one of the most diverse geographic regions in the world. Soaring mountains, powerful rivers, and fertile plains are some of the key physical features of the Indian Subcontinent.

### Mountains
The northern edge of the Indian Subcontinent is defined by the Himalaya mountain range. The Himalayas are the highest mountains in the world. They stretch for about 1,500 miles (2,400 km) along the northern borders of Pakistan, India, Nepal, and Bhutan.

The Himalayas include the world's tallest mountain, **Mount Everest**, which rises 29,035 feet (8,850 m) above sea level. Mount Everest is located on the border between Nepal and China. The Himalayas are still growing taller as the Indian Subcontinent continues to push northward into the rest of Asia.

The Himalayas have a major impact on the climate of the Indian Subcontinent. They block cold winds from the north, keeping South Asia warmer than other regions at the same latitude. The mountains also block rain clouds from moving north, causing heavy rainfall on the southern slopes.

### Rivers
Several major rivers flow through the Indian Subcontinent. The **Ganges River** (GAN-jeez) begins in the Himalayas and flows east across northern India. It forms part of the border between India and Bangladesh before flowing into the Bay of Bengal. The Ganges is one of the world's longest rivers, stretching about 1,560 miles (2,510 km).

The Ganges River valley is one of the most fertile and densely populated regions in the world. The river provides water for drinking and irrigation. It also serves as an important transportation route. Many Hindus, followers of India's main religion, consider the Ganges sacred. They believe that bathing in the river washes away sins.

Near its mouth, the Ganges joins with another river, the Brahmaputra (brah-muh-POO-truh), to form a huge **delta**. A delta is a triangular area of land formed by deposits of silt at the mouth of a river. The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta is one of the largest in the world. Much of Bangladesh lies within this delta.

The **Indus River** begins in the Himalayas and flows southwest through Pakistan to the Arabian Sea. The Indus River valley was the site of one of the world's earliest civilizations. Today, the river provides water for irrigation in Pakistan.

### Plains and Plateaus
South of the Himalayas lie the fertile plains of the Ganges and Indus rivers. These plains are part of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, which stretches across northern India and Pakistan. The plain is formed by deposits of silt from the rivers. It is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world.

South of the Indo-Gangetic Plain is the Deccan Plateau. This triangular plateau covers most of southern India. It is bordered by mountain ranges called the Eastern and Western Ghats. The plateau slopes gently from west to east. Most of its rivers flow eastward into the Bay of Bengal.

### Islands
Several island nations are part of the Indian Subcontinent. Sri Lanka is a large island nation located off the southeastern coast of India. The Maldives is a nation made up of about 1,200 small coral islands in the Indian Ocean southwest of India.

## Climate and Resources
The Indian Subcontinent has a variety of climate regions due to its diverse physical features. It also has abundant natural resources, though these are not evenly distributed.

### Climate Regions
The climate of the Indian Subcontinent varies greatly from region to region. The Himalayas have a highland climate with cold temperatures year-round at higher elevations. The Indo-Gangetic Plain has a humid subtropical climate with hot summers and mild winters. The Deccan Plateau has a tropical climate with high temperatures year-round.

One of the most important climate features of the Indian Subcontinent is the **monsoons**. Monsoons are seasonal winds that bring dramatic changes in rainfall. During the summer, warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean flows over the subcontinent, bringing heavy rainfall. During the winter, cool, dry air flows from the interior of Asia, bringing dry conditions.

The summer monsoon typically begins in June and lasts until September. It brings about 80 percent of the region's annual rainfall. The monsoon is crucial for agriculture, but it can also cause devastating floods. If the monsoon is weak, drought can occur, leading to crop failures and food shortages.

### Natural Resources
The Indian Subcontinent has abundant natural resources. India has large deposits of coal, iron ore, manganese, and bauxite. It also has significant reserves of natural gas. Pakistan has natural gas, coal, and some oil. Bangladesh has natural gas and coal.

The region's fertile soil is one of its most valuable resources. The Indo-Gangetic Plain is particularly productive, supporting intensive agriculture. The rivers provide water for irrigation and hydroelectric power.

Forests cover about 20 percent of India, providing timber and other forest products. However, deforestation is a serious problem as forests are cleared for agriculture and development.

## Environmental Challenges
The Indian Subcontinent faces several environmental challenges. Deforestation, water pollution, and air pollution are major concerns. Rapid population growth and industrialization have put pressure on the region's natural resources.

Water pollution is a particular problem in the Ganges River. Industrial waste, sewage, and religious practices (such as cremation) contribute to the pollution. The Indian government has launched several initiatives to clean up the river, but progress has been slow.

Air pollution is severe in many cities, especially in northern India. Delhi, India's capital, often has some of the worst air quality in the world. The pollution comes from vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and the burning of crop residue in surrounding agricultural areas.

Climate change poses additional challenges. Rising sea levels threaten coastal areas and the low-lying Maldives. Changes in monsoon patterns could affect agriculture and water supplies.

## Assessment

1. **Key Terms and Places** Write a short definition for each term.
   - subcontinent
   - Mount Everest
   - Ganges River
   - delta
   - Indus River
   - monsoons

2. **Main Ideas**
   a. Recall: What are the major physical features of the Indian Subcontinent?
   b. Draw Conclusions: Why are rivers important to the people of the Indian Subcontinent?
   c. Evaluate: Do you think monsoons have a positive or negative effect on India? Why?

3. **Critical Thinking**
   a. Make Inferences: Why would the thick vegetation of Central Africa forests cause people to live in small villages?
   b. Compare and Contrast: How are the climate zones of West Africa different from those of Central Africa?
