# Lesson 3: India's Neighbors

## The Big Idea
Despite cultural differences, the countries that border India share similar challenges.

## Main Ideas
- Many different ethnic groups and religions influence the culture of India's neighbors.
- Rapid population growth, ethnic conflicts, and environmental threats are major challenges to the region today.

## If YOU lived there...
You live in the mountainous country of Bhutan. For many years, Bhutan's leaders kept the country isolated from outsiders. Recently, they have begun to allow more tourists to enter the country. Some of your neighbors believe that tourism will greatly benefit the country. Others think it could harm the environment.

## Culture
Five countries—Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka—share the subcontinent with India. Though they are neighbors, these countries have significantly different cultures.

### People
The cultures of the countries that border India reflect the customs of many ethnic groups. For example, the **Sherpas**, an ethnic group from the mountains of Nepal, often serve as guides through the Himalayas. Members of Bhutan's largest ethnic group originally came from Tibet, a region in southern China. Many of Sri Lanka's Tamil (TA-muhl) people came from India to work the country's huge plantations.

### Religion
As you can see on the map, a variety of religions are practiced in the countries that border India. Islam is the main religion in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Most people in Nepal and Bhutan practice Hinduism or Buddhism. Sri Lanka has a Buddhist majority, but it also has significant Hindu, Muslim, and Christian minorities.

Religion plays an important role in the daily lives of most people in the region. Religious beliefs influence what people eat, how they dress, and how they interact with others. Religious festivals and holidays are important community events.

### Languages
The countries of the Indian Subcontinent have many different languages. Pakistan has two official languages: Urdu and English. However, many Pakistanis speak Punjabi, Sindhi, or other regional languages.

Bangladesh's official language is Bengali. Nepal has several official languages, including Nepali. Bhutan's official language is Dzongkha (dzawng-kuh), but English is widely used in schools and government. Sri Lanka has two official languages: Sinhala and Tamil.

Many of these languages have different **dialects**, or variations, spoken in different regions. This linguistic diversity reflects the region's cultural richness but can also create communication challenges.

## Challenges
The countries that border India face many challenges, including political instability, economic development issues, and environmental threats.

### Political Challenges
Several countries in the region have experienced political instability. Pakistan has alternated between civilian governments and military rule since its independence. Bangladesh has also had periods of military rule and political unrest.

**Kashmir** is a region in the Himalayas claimed by both India and Pakistan. The dispute over Kashmir has led to several wars between the two countries and continues to be a source of tension. Both countries now have nuclear weapons, making the conflict particularly dangerous.

Sri Lanka experienced a long civil war (1983-2009) between the government and Tamil separatists. The conflict ended with a government victory, but tensions between ethnic groups remain.

Nepal had a civil war (1996-2006) between government forces and Maoist rebels. After the war, Nepal abolished its monarchy and became a republic. However, political instability has continued.

Bhutan has been more politically stable. It was an absolute monarchy until 2008, when it became a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament.

### Economic Challenges
The countries that border India are at different stages of economic development, but all face significant challenges.

Pakistan has a diverse economy with agriculture, textiles, and services as major sectors. However, it struggles with high poverty rates, energy shortages, and security concerns that deter foreign investment.

Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated countries. Its capital, **Dhaka**, is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Bangladesh's economy has grown rapidly in recent years, particularly its garment industry. However, it remains a poor country with high poverty rates and vulnerability to natural disasters.

Nepal is one of the poorest countries in Asia. Its economy depends heavily on agriculture, tourism, and remittances (money sent home by Nepalese working abroad). **Kathmandu**, Nepal's capital, is a major tourist destination and the gateway for climbers attempting to scale Mount Everest.

Bhutan has prioritized "Gross National Happiness" over economic growth. It has limited tourism to preserve its culture and environment. Bhutan's economy is based on agriculture, forestry, and hydroelectric power, which it sells to India.

Sri Lanka has a higher standard of living than its neighbors. Its economy is based on agriculture (especially tea and rubber), textiles, and tourism. However, the civil war set back its economic development, and it faces challenges such as high public debt.

### Environmental Challenges
The countries of the Indian Subcontinent face various environmental challenges. Deforestation is a problem in Nepal and Bhutan, where forests are cleared for agriculture and timber. Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to flooding and cyclones due to its low elevation and location in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.

Climate change poses additional threats to the region. Rising sea levels could inundate coastal areas of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Melting Himalayan glaciers could affect water supplies in Nepal, Bhutan, and Pakistan.

The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caused extensive damage and loss of life in Sri Lanka. The tsunami, triggered by an underwater earthquake, killed about 35,000 people in Sri Lanka and displaced hundreds of thousands more.

## Pakistan
Pakistan, located northwest of India, is the second-largest country on the Indian Subcontinent. It was created in 1947 when the British partitioned their Indian colony into two countries: India for Hindus and Pakistan for Muslims.

### History and Government
Pakistan was initially divided into two parts: West Pakistan and East Pakistan, separated by more than 1,000 miles of Indian territory. In 1971, East Pakistan broke away to form the independent country of Bangladesh after a brief but bloody war.

Pakistan has struggled to establish a stable democracy. It has experienced several periods of military rule, most recently under General Pervez Musharraf (2001-2008). Since 2008, Pakistan has had civilian governments, but the military remains powerful.

Pakistan's relations with India have been tense since independence. The two countries have fought several wars, primarily over the disputed region of Kashmir. In recent years, there have been efforts to improve relations, but progress has been slow.

### Economy and Society
Pakistan's economy is based on agriculture, textiles, and services. Major crops include cotton, wheat, rice, and sugarcane. The textile industry is a significant employer and export earner.

Pakistan faces several economic challenges, including high poverty rates, energy shortages, and a large informal economy. The government has implemented reforms to address these issues, but progress has been uneven.

Pakistani society is diverse, with several ethnic groups and languages. The largest ethnic group is the Punjabis, followed by Pashtuns, Sindhis, and others. Islam is the dominant religion, practiced by about 96 percent of the population.

## Bangladesh
Bangladesh, located east of India, is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. It was part of Pakistan until 1971, when it gained independence after a nine-month war.

### History and Government
Bangladesh was known as East Pakistan from 1947 to 1971. Cultural and linguistic differences, as well as economic disparities, led to tensions with West Pakistan. In 1971, East Pakistan declared independence, leading to a war in which India supported the Bengali independence movement.

Since independence, Bangladesh has alternated between periods of democratic rule and military government. The two main political parties—the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party—have dominated politics.

### Economy and Society
Bangladesh's economy has grown rapidly in recent years, with the garment industry as a major driver. Bangladesh is now the world's second-largest exporter of ready-made garments after China.

Despite economic growth, Bangladesh remains a poor country with high poverty rates. It is also highly vulnerable to natural disasters, particularly cyclones and flooding. Climate change and rising sea levels pose significant threats to Bangladesh's low-lying coastal areas.

Bengali culture is influenced by both Hindu and Muslim traditions. The Bengali language and literature are important parts of the national identity. The majority of Bangladeshis are Muslims, but there are also Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian minorities.

## Nepal
Nepal is a landlocked country located in the Himalayas between India and China. It is known for its stunning mountain scenery, including Mount Everest, the world's highest peak.

### History and Government
Nepal was never colonized by European powers. It was ruled by a monarchy until 2008, when it became a republic after a decade-long civil war between government forces and Maoist rebels.

Since becoming a republic, Nepal has experienced political instability, with frequent changes of government. However, it has made progress in establishing democratic institutions and addressing the grievances that fueled the civil war.

### Economy and Society
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in Asia. Its economy is based on agriculture, tourism, and remittances from Nepalese working abroad. Tourism is centered on trekking and mountaineering in the Himalayas.

Nepal's society is diverse, with many ethnic groups, languages, and religions. Hinduism is the main religion, followed by Buddhism. The caste system still influences social interactions, especially in rural areas.

Nepal faces several development challenges, including poor infrastructure, political instability, and vulnerability to natural disasters. A major earthquake in 2015 killed nearly 9,000 people and caused extensive damage.

## Bhutan
Bhutan is a small, mountainous country located between India and China. It is known for its policy of "Gross National Happiness," which prioritizes well-being and environmental conservation over economic growth.

### History and Government
Bhutan has a long history as an independent kingdom. Unlike many of its neighbors, it was never colonized by European powers. For centuries, Bhutan deliberately isolated itself from the outside world to preserve its culture and independence.

In 2008, Bhutan transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The transition was initiated by the king himself, who wanted to modernize the country's political system.

### Economy and Society
Bhutan's economy is based on agriculture, forestry, and hydroelectric power, which it sells to India. Tourism is strictly controlled to minimize its impact on the environment and culture. Visitors must pay a daily fee and travel with a licensed guide.

Bhutanese culture is strongly influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. Monasteries and religious festivals play an important role in daily life. The government actively promotes traditional culture, requiring citizens to wear national dress for official occasions and maintaining traditional architectural styles.

## Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka is an island nation located off the southeastern coast of India. It is known for its diverse landscapes, ancient ruins, and tea plantations.

### History and Government
Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, was colonized by the Portuguese, Dutch, and British before gaining independence in 1948. After independence, tensions grew between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil populations.

These tensions erupted into a civil war in 1983 between the government and Tamil separatists known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The war lasted 26 years and ended in 2009 with a government victory. The conflict caused significant loss of life and displacement.

Since the end of the civil war, Sri Lanka has worked to rebuild and reconcile its divided society. However, ethnic tensions remain, and there are concerns about human rights abuses during and after the war.

### Economy and Society
Sri Lanka has a higher standard of living than many of its neighbors. Its economy is based on agriculture (especially tea and rubber), textiles, and tourism. The civil war set back economic development, but the economy has grown since the conflict ended.

Sri Lankan culture reflects the island's diverse population and long history. The majority of Sri Lankans are Sinhalese Buddhists, but there are significant Tamil Hindu, Muslim, and Christian minorities. Each group has its own traditions, festivals, and cuisine.
