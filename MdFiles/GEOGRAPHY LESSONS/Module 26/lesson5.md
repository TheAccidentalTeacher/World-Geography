# Lesson 5: Indian Empires

## The Big Idea
The Mauryas, the Guptas, and the Mughals built great empires in India and made important contributions to the arts and sciences.

## Main Ideas
- The Mauryan Empire united most of India for the first time.
- The Gupta Empire oversaw a golden age of arts and sciences.
- The Mughal Empire brought together Hindu and Muslim traditions.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a scholar living in India during the Gupta Empire. It is a time of great learning and creativity. The emperor supports the arts and sciences. You have studied mathematics for many years. Recently, you have been working on a difficult problem involving the calculation of the area of a circle. You think you may have found a more accurate value of pi than anyone before you.

## The Mauryan Empire

The Mauryan Empire was the first major empire to unite most of the Indian subcontinent. It flourished from approximately 322 BCE to 185 BCE and laid the foundations for future Indian states.

### Rise of the Mauryan Empire

#### Historical Context
Before the Mauryan Empire, India was divided into numerous small kingdoms and republics. Two major developments set the stage for unification:
- **Alexander the Great's Invasion**: In 326 BCE, Alexander invaded northwestern India, defeating King Porus. Though Alexander soon retreated, his invasion disrupted existing power structures.
- **Power Vacuum**: After Alexander's departure, the region was politically unstable, creating an opportunity for a new power to emerge.

#### Chandragupta Maurya
The empire was founded by Chandragupta Maurya (reign c. 322-298 BCE):
- According to tradition, he was guided by Chanakya (also known as Kautilya), a brilliant strategist and political theorist
- He overthrew the Nanda dynasty and seized control of the Magadha kingdom
- He defeated Alexander's successor in the northwest, Seleucus Nicator
- He expanded his territory through military campaigns and diplomatic alliances
- By the end of his reign, he controlled most of northern India

#### Chanakya and the Arthashastra
Chanakya is credited with authoring the Arthashastra, an ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, economic policy, and military strategy:
- It provides detailed guidance on running an efficient administration
- It outlines principles of taxation, foreign policy, and warfare
- It describes methods for maintaining internal security, including the use of spies
- It advocates pragmatic, sometimes ruthless, approaches to maintaining power
- It remains one of the most comprehensive ancient works on governance

### Ashoka the Great

The greatest Mauryan ruler was Ashoka (reign c. 268-232 BCE), Chandragupta's grandson:

#### Early Reign and Kalinga War
- Ashoka initially followed an expansionist policy like his predecessors
- In 260 BCE, he waged a brutal war against Kalinga (modern Odisha)
- The bloodshed and suffering of this war profoundly affected him
- According to his own edicts, he was horrified by the death and deportation of over 100,000 people

#### Conversion to Buddhism
After the Kalinga War, Ashoka converted to Buddhism:
- He embraced the teachings of non-violence (ahimsa)
- He renounced warfare and conquest
- He dedicated himself to the welfare of his subjects
- He promoted Buddhist principles throughout his empire

#### Ashoka's Dhamma
Ashoka promoted a moral code he called "Dhamma" (Dharma):
- It emphasized non-violence, tolerance, and compassion
- It encouraged respect for all religious traditions
- It promoted ethical behavior in personal and public life
- It was not identical to Buddhism but incorporated many Buddhist principles

#### Governance and Public Works
Ashoka was an effective administrator:
- He divided his empire into provinces governed by royal princes or officials
- He established a sophisticated civil service
- He built roads, rest houses, hospitals, and universities
- He planted trees and dug wells for public use
- He created a system of pillars and rock edicts to communicate his policies

#### Ashoka's Edicts
Ashoka's rock and pillar edicts, carved throughout his empire, provide valuable insights into his reign:
- They were written in various languages and scripts
- They proclaimed his policies and moral principles
- They encouraged ethical behavior and religious tolerance
- They described his administrative reforms
- They serve as important historical documents about his rule

### Mauryan Administration and Society

#### Government Structure
The Mauryan Empire had a centralized administration:
- The emperor was the supreme authority
- A council of ministers advised the emperor
- Provincial governors (often royal relatives) administered regions
- Local officials collected taxes and maintained order
- Spies monitored officials and public opinion

#### Economy
The Mauryan economy was carefully regulated:
- Agriculture was the economic foundation
- Trade was encouraged through improved roads and security
- State monopolies controlled mining, shipbuilding, and weapons production
- Standardized weights, measures, and currency facilitated commerce
- Taxation was systematic and comprehensive

#### Military
The Mauryan military was large and well-organized:
- According to Greek sources, it included 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, and 9,000 elephants
- A war office administered military affairs
- Specialized officers managed different branches of the military
- Fortifications protected cities and strategic locations
- The navy patrolled rivers and coastal areas

#### Society and Culture
Mauryan society was diverse and complex:
- The caste system structured social relationships
- Cities grew as centers of administration and trade
- Various religions coexisted, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism
- Art and architecture flourished, especially under Ashoka
- Education was valued, particularly in religious centers

### Decline of the Mauryan Empire

After Ashoka's death in 232 BCE, the empire began to decline:
- Weak successors could not maintain central authority
- Provincial governors became increasingly independent
- The military weakened due to Ashoka's emphasis on peace
- The treasury was depleted by Ashoka's extensive public works
- External pressures from Greek kingdoms in the northwest increased

In 185 BCE, the last Mauryan emperor was assassinated by his commander-in-chief, Pushyamitra Shunga, who established the Shunga dynasty. The unified empire fragmented into smaller kingdoms, ending India's first imperial age.

### Legacy of the Mauryan Empire
The Mauryan Empire left a lasting impact on Indian history:
- It demonstrated the possibility of unifying the diverse Indian subcontinent
- It established administrative systems that influenced later governments
- It spread Buddhism throughout South and Southeast Asia
- It created a model of enlightened kingship through Ashoka's example
- It facilitated cultural exchange between India and other civilizations

## The Gupta Empire

After the fall of the Mauryan Empire, India was divided into numerous kingdoms for several centuries. Around 320 CE, a new empire emerged that would usher in what is often called India's "Golden Age"â€”the Gupta Empire.

### Rise of the Gupta Empire

### Decline of the Gupta Empire

The Gupta Empire began to decline in the late 5th century CE:
- **Hun Invasions**: Nomadic groups from Central Asia, particularly the Hephthalites (White Huns), attacked the northwestern frontiers
- **Military Setbacks**: Despite resistance by rulers like Skandagupta, the empire lost territory and resources
- **Economic Strain**: Defending against invasions drained the treasury
- **Decentralization**: Provincial governors asserted independence
- **Internal Succession Disputes**: Weakened central authority

By the mid-6th century CE, the Gupta Empire had disintegrated into smaller kingdoms. Northern India again entered a period of political fragmentation that would last until the rise of the Delhi Sultanate in the 13th century.

### Legacy of the Gupta Empire
The Gupta period left an enduring cultural legacy:
- It established classical standards in art, literature, and science
- It developed mathematical concepts that spread globally
- It created a model of Hindu kingship that influenced later rulers
- It fostered religious and philosophical systems that continue today
- It represented a high point of indigenous Indian civilization before significant external influences

## The Mughal Empire

After centuries of regional kingdoms and the Delhi Sultanate, a new empire arose in the 16th century that would once again unify most of Indiaâ€”the Mughal Empire.

### Rise of the Mughal Empire

#### Historical Context
Before the Mughals, the Indian subcontinent was divided:
- The Delhi Sultanate had fragmented into smaller sultanates
- Hindu kingdoms like Vijayanagara controlled parts of the south
- Regional powers like the Rajputs maintained independence in Rajasthan

### Aurangzeb and the Beginning of Decline

The last great Mughal emperor was Aurangzeb (reign 1658-1707), whose policies contributed to the empire's eventual decline:

#### Rise to Power
Aurangzeb gained the throne through conflict:
- He defeated his brothers in a war of succession
- He imprisoned his father, Shah Jahan, who lived out his final years in captivity
- He executed rivals to secure his position
- He presented himself as a defender of orthodox Islam

#### Military Campaigns
Aurangzeb expanded the empire to its greatest territorial extent:
- He conquered the Deccan sultanates
- He pushed into southern India against the Marathas
- He reasserted control over frontier regions
- These campaigns stretched imperial resources and manpower

#### Religious Policy
Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb promoted orthodox Islam:
- He reinstated the jizya tax on non-Muslims
- He destroyed some Hindu temples
- He enforced Islamic law more strictly
- He banned music and other practices deemed un-Islamic
- These policies alienated many Hindu subjects and sparked resistance

#### Administrative Challenges
Despite his abilities, Aurangzeb faced growing problems:
- The empire became too large to administer effectively
- Constant warfare drained the treasury
- Corruption increased among officials
- Regional powers began asserting independence
- Religious tensions undermined imperial unity

### Decline of the Mughal Empire

After Aurangzeb's death in 1707, the empire entered a period of decline:

- **Wars of Succession**: Each transition of power involved destructive conflicts
- **Rise of Regional Powers**: The Marathas, Sikhs, Jats, and others carved out territories
- **Economic Problems**: The treasury was depleted and the tax system broke down
- **Foreign Invasions**: Persian and Afghan invasions further weakened the empire

By the mid-18th century, the Mughal emperor was largely a figurehead, controlling little beyond Delhi. The empire officially continued until 1857, when the British deposed the last emperor after the Indian Rebellion.

### European Arrival and the Transition to Colonial Rule

As the Mughal Empire declined, European powers increased their presence:
- **Portuguese**: Established coastal trading posts in the 16th century
- **Dutch**: Competed for trade in the 17th century
- **French**: Established trading companies and territorial ambitions
- **British**: The East India Company gradually expanded from trading to territorial control

The British eventually emerged dominant:
- They defeated French forces in the Carnatic Wars
- They gained control of Bengal after the Battle of Plassey (1757)
- They expanded through a combination of conquest, treaties, and annexation
- By the mid-19th century, they controlled most of the subcontinent
- After the 1857 Rebellion, the British Crown formally replaced the East India Company

### Legacy of the Mughal Empire
The Mughal Empire left an enduring impact on Indian civilization:
- It created a synthesis of Persian, Islamic, and Indian cultural elements
- It produced magnificent architectural monuments that symbolize India today
- It developed administrative systems that influenced later governance
