# Lesson 1: Early Indian Civilizations

## The Big Idea
Indian civilization first developed along the Indus River.

## Main Ideas
- Located on the Indus River, the Harappan civilization also had contact with people far from India.
- Harappan achievements included a writing system, city planning, and arts and crafts.
- The Aryans brought new ideas and practices to India.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a trader in the huge city of Mohenjo-Daro. Your business is booming, as traders come to the city from all over Asia. With your new wealth, you have bought a huge house with a rooftop terrace and even indoor plumbing! This morning, however, you heard that invaders are headed toward the city. People are telling you that you should flee for your safety.

**What will you miss most about life in the city?**

## Geography of India

India is a subcontinent, a large landmass that is smaller than a continent. The Indian subcontinent extends southward from the Asian continent into the Indian Ocean. Today, this region includes the countries of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.

### Natural Barriers
India is separated from the rest of Asia by natural barriers:
- To the north, the Himalaya Mountains form a nearly impassable wall. These include Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain.
- To the northwest, the Hindu Kush mountains create another barrier.
- To the east, mountains and dense jungles separate India from Southeast Asia.
- The Indian Ocean surrounds the subcontinent on the south, east, and west.

These natural barriers helped protect India from invasion and allowed Indian civilization to develop independently. However, several mountain passes in the northwest, particularly the Khyber Pass, provided routes for trade and migration.

### River Valleys
Two major river systems have shaped Indian civilization:
1. **The Indus River** flows from the Himalayas southwest through modern Pakistan before emptying into the Arabian Sea. The Indus Valley was the site of India's first civilization.
2. **The Ganges River** flows from the Himalayas southeast across northern India before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. The Ganges Valley later became the heartland of Indian civilization.

These river valleys provided:
- Fertile soil for agriculture
- Water for irrigation
- Transportation routes
- Sites for major cities

### Climate
India's climate is dominated by monsoons, seasonal winds that bring dramatic changes in rainfall:
- The summer monsoon blows from the southwest, bringing heavy rainfall from June to September
- The winter monsoon blows from the northeast and is generally dry
- The monsoon pattern creates distinct wet and dry seasons

This climate pattern shaped agriculture and daily life. Farmers depended on the monsoon rains for their crops, and the entire society developed around this seasonal rhythm.

## The Harappan Civilization

Around 2500 BCE, a sophisticated urban civilization developed in the Indus Valley. Archaeologists call this the Harappan civilization after Harappa, one of its major cities. It is also known as the Indus Valley Civilization.

### Discovery
The Harappan civilization was unknown to modern scholars until the 1920s, when archaeologists began excavating the ruins of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. These excavations revealed a sophisticated urban civilization that was contemporary with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.

### Urban Centers
The Harappan civilization was remarkably urban, with several large, carefully planned cities:
- **Mohenjo-Daro** and **Harappa** were the largest, each covering more than 250 acres
- Streets were laid out in a grid pattern, with main roads running north-south and east-west
- Buildings were constructed of standardized baked bricks
- Houses had indoor plumbing, with bathrooms connected to sophisticated drainage systems
- Cities included large public buildings, possibly for government or religious purposes

### Economy and Trade
The Harappan economy was based on agriculture, crafts, and trade:
- Farmers grew wheat, barley, peas, and cotton
- Artisans produced pottery, metal tools, and jewelry
- Merchants traded with distant regions

Evidence of Harappan trade connections includes:
- Harappan seals found in Mesopotamia
- Mesopotamian artifacts found in Harappan cities
- Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan
- Gold from southern India
- Jade from China

### Technology and Achievements
The Harappans developed several important technologies:
- A system of standardized weights and measures
- Advanced metallurgy, including work in copper, bronze, lead, and tin
- Sophisticated pottery made on wheels
- Cotton textiles (the earliest known in the world)
- A writing system that has not yet been deciphered

### Social Organization
While much remains unknown about Harappan society, archaeological evidence suggests:
- A centralized authority that maintained urban planning standards
- Social stratification, with differences in housing size and quality
- Possible religious practices centered on ritual bathing and fertility symbols
- No evidence of palaces or temples, unlike contemporary civilizations

### Decline
Around 1900-1700 BCE, the Harappan civilization began to decline. Possible causes include:
- Environmental changes, including shifts in river courses
- Climate change and drought
- Deforestation and soil exhaustion
- Invasion or migration of new peoples

By 1500 BCE, the great Harappan cities were abandoned, and the sophisticated urban culture disappeared.

## The Aryan Migration

As the Harappan civilization declined, a new group of people began to enter India through the mountain passes of the northwest. These were the Aryans, a nomadic Indo-European people from Central Asia.

### Who Were the Aryans?
The Aryans were:
- Speakers of an Indo-European language (early Sanskrit)
- Originally pastoral nomads who herded cattle
- Organized in tribal groups led by chiefs or rajas
- Skilled warriors who used horse-drawn chariots

### The Aryan Migration
Between approximately 1500 and 1000 BCE, Aryan groups gradually moved into northern India:
- They first settled in the Punjab region (the land of five rivers)
- They gradually moved eastward into the Ganges Valley
- They eventually spread throughout northern India

This was not a single invasion but a gradual migration over centuries. The Aryans interacted with and absorbed many elements of the indigenous cultures they encountered.

### Vedic Period
The period from approximately 1500 to 500 BCE is known as the Vedic Period, named after the Vedas, the sacred texts composed during this time. During this period:
- Aryans transitioned from nomadic herding to settled agriculture
- Small kingdoms emerged, often in conflict with each other
- A complex society developed with distinct social classes
- Religious practices evolved into early Hinduism

### Vedic Literature
The Aryans had no writing system initially but composed and memorized an extensive oral literature:
- **The Rigveda**: A collection of over 1,000 hymns to various gods
- **Other Vedas**: Collections of rituals, spells, and philosophical discussions
- **The Upanishads**: Philosophical texts exploring the nature of reality and the self
- **The Mahabharata and Ramayana**: Epic poems containing stories, moral teachings, and religious ideas

These texts, eventually written down, provide our main source of information about Vedic society and culture.

### Social Structure: The Caste System
During the Vedic period, a complex social hierarchy developed that would later become the caste system:
1. **Brahmins**: Priests and scholars
2. **Kshatriyas**: Warriors and rulers
3. **Vaishyas**: Merchants, artisans, and farmers
4. **Shudras**: Laborers and servants

A fifth group, later called "untouchables" or Dalits, performed tasks considered ritually impure.

This system:
- Determined occupation and social status by birth
- Regulated marriage and social interaction
- Became increasingly rigid over time
- Was justified by religious beliefs about karma and dharma

### Religious Developments
The Aryan religion evolved significantly during the Vedic period:
- Early focus on nature deities and ritual sacrifices
- Gradual development of abstract philosophical concepts
- Emergence of ideas like karma (actions affecting future lives), dharma (duty), and samsara (cycle of rebirth)
- Development of practices like yoga and meditation
- Synthesis with indigenous religious elements

These religious developments eventually led to the formation of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

## The Legacy of Early Indian Civilizations

The Harappan and Vedic periods laid the foundations for Indian civilization:

### From the Harappans
- Urban planning and architectural techniques
- Trade networks connecting India with other regions
- Technological innovations in metallurgy and crafts
- Possible religious elements that were absorbed into later traditions

### From the Vedic Period
- The Sanskrit language and its literary tradition
- The caste system that structured Indian society for thousands of years
- Religious and philosophical concepts that developed into Hinduism
- Political structures that evolved into the kingdoms and empires of classical India

Together, these early civilizations created the cultural foundation upon which later Indian civilization would build.
