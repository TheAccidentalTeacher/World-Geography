# Lesson 4: Sikhism

## The Big Idea
Sikhism originated in the Punjab region of India and has grown to include nearly 25 million followers around the world.

## Main Ideas
- Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak in the late 15th century.

- Sikhs are known for their commitment to service and equality.

## If YOU lived there...
You are living in northern India in the late 1400s. Religious conflict between Hindus and Muslims is common. One day, you hear about a new teacher named Guru Nanak who says that there is no Hindu and no Muslimâ€”that all people are equal in God's eyes. Some of your Hindu friends are angry about this teaching, but you are curious.

**What questions would you want to ask Guru Nanak?**

## Origins of Sikhism

Sikhism emerged in the Punjab region of South Asia (now divided between India and Pakistan) during a time of religious and social tension between Hindus and Muslims.

### Historical Context
In the 15th century, the Punjab was:
- Under Mughal (Muslim) political control
- Home to a Hindu majority population
- A region with significant religious conflict
- Stratified by the Hindu caste system

### Guru Nanak
Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak (1469-1539):
- Born in Talwandi (now Nankana Sahib, Pakistan) to a Hindu family
- Showed spiritual inclination from childhood
- Worked as an accountant but was drawn to spiritual matters
- At age 30, had a profound spiritual experience
- After this experience, declared: "There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim"
- Began teaching a message of one God and human equality

### Guru Nanak's Travels
After his spiritual awakening, Guru Nanak traveled extensively to spread his message:
- Journeyed throughout South Asia
- Visited important Hindu and Muslim pilgrimage sites
- Traveled as far as Baghdad, Mecca, and possibly Tibet
- Engaged in dialogues with religious leaders of various faiths

### Founding Principles
Guru Nanak established core principles that would define Sikhism:

- Established congregational worship with devotional singing
- Appointed a successor to continue his mission
- Began a distinct religious tradition that was neither Hindu nor Muslim
