## Key Concepts

Every day, people all over the world purchase goods and services from other people. Goods are products that people consume or use, such as food or tools. Services are things that people do. For example, a school nurse provides a service by helping students who are sick or hurt. How people get goods and services is determined by global, national, and local economies. An economy is a system of producing, selling, and buying goods and services. The study of economies is called economics.

### Scarcity and Choice

Economists, who study economics, say that we all face the same basic problem. This problem is scarcity. Scarcity is when there are not enough resources to meet people's wants. People's wants are unlimited, but the resources available to satisfy their wants are limited.

When a resource becomes scarce, it is harder for producers to get. So, products made with that resource become more difficult for consumers to find. As a result, the prices for these items usually rise.

Scarcity forces us to make choices. We must decide what things we need and want. Choices always come with costs. For every choice you make, you give up something else. In economics, this choice is called a tradeoff. The value of the thing you give up in the tradeoff is called an opportunity cost. For example, suppose you get some money for your birthday. You want to use it to buy a new video game, but your friends invite you to play laser tag. You don't have enough money for both. If you choose the video game, the value of the laser tag games is the opportunity cost. It's the value of the next best choice you gave up in order to get what you wanted more.

### Factors of Production

Scarcity shapes how societies use factors of production. Factors of production are the resources used to make goods and services. There are four main factors of production: land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.

#### Land
Land includes all natural resources. It includes the land itself, as well as minerals, water, and other resources found on or under the land. For example, a farm uses land to grow crops. A mining company uses land to extract minerals. A timber company uses land to grow and harvest trees.

#### Labor
Labor is the work that people do. It includes physical work, such as digging ditches or building houses, and mental work, such as designing buildings or writing computer programs. Labor also includes the skills and knowledge that people bring to their work. For example, a doctor uses years of education and training to provide medical services.

#### Capital
Capital includes the tools, equipment, and buildings used to produce goods and services. For example, a factory uses machines to produce goods. A restaurant uses ovens, refrigerators, and other equipment to prepare food. A school uses buildings, desks, and computers to provide education.

Capital also includes money that is used to buy tools, equipment, and buildings. For example, a business might borrow money to buy a new machine or build a new factory.

#### Entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship is the ability to organize the other factors of production to create goods and services. Entrepreneurs take risks by starting new businesses or developing new products. They hope to earn a profit, which is the money left over after all costs are paid. For example, an entrepreneur might start a new restaurant, develop a new app, or create a new type of clothing.

### Economic Cycles

Economies go through cycles of growth and contraction. During periods of growth, or expansion, businesses produce more goods and services, hire more workers, and earn more profits. During periods of contraction, businesses produce fewer goods and services, lay off workers, and earn less profit.

These cycles affect individuals and families. During expansions, it's easier to find jobs and earn higher wages. During contractions, it's harder to find jobs, and wages may not increase or may even decrease.

### Economic Interdependence

In today's world, economies are increasingly interconnected. This is called economic interdependence. Countries trade goods and services with each other. Businesses in one country may rely on resources or components from other countries. For example, a car manufacturer in the United States might use parts made in Mexico, Japan, and Germany.

Economic interdependence means that economic events in one country can affect other countries. For example, if there's a recession in the United States, it can reduce demand for products from China, which can lead to job losses in Chinese factories.

## Supply and Demand

The concepts of supply and demand are fundamental to understanding how markets work.

### Supply

Supply refers to the amount of a good or service that producers are willing and able to sell at various prices. Generally, as the price of a good increases, producers are willing to supply more of it because they can earn higher profits. This relationship between price and quantity supplied is known as the law of supply.

For example, if the price of wheat increases, farmers may decide to plant more wheat and less of other crops. They may also use more fertilizer and other inputs to increase their wheat yield. As a result, the supply of wheat increases.

### Demand

Demand refers to the amount of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices. Generally, as the price of a good decreases, consumers are willing to buy more of it. This relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the law of demand.

For example, if the price of coffee decreases, people may buy more coffee. They may drink coffee more often or switch from tea to coffee. As a result, the demand for coffee increases.

### Market Equilibrium

The interaction of supply and demand determines the market price and quantity of a good or service. The point where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded is called the market equilibrium.

If the price is above the equilibrium price, the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity demanded, resulting in a surplus. Producers will then lower their prices to sell the surplus, bringing the price down toward the equilibrium.

If the price is below the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied, resulting in a shortage. Consumers will bid up the price to obtain the scarce good, bringing the price up toward the equilibrium.

## Income and Spending

Income is the money that individuals and families earn from working, owning businesses, or investing. People use their income to buy goods and services, save for the future, and pay taxes.

### Sources of Income

People earn income in various ways:

1. **Wages and Salaries**: Money earned from working for someone else. For example, a teacher earns a salary from a school district.

2. **Business Income**: Money earned from owning a business. For example, a restaurant owner earns income from the profits of the restaurant.

3. **Investment Income**: Money earned from investments, such as interest on savings accounts, dividends from stocks, or rent from property.

4. **Transfer Payments**: Money received from the government, such as Social Security benefits, unemployment benefits, or welfare payments.

### Spending Decisions

People must decide how to spend their income. They must balance their needs and wants with their limited resources. This involves making tradeoffs and considering opportunity costs.

For example, a family might need to decide whether to spend money on a vacation or save for college. If they choose the vacation, the opportunity cost is the value of the college savings they gave up.

## Conclusion

Economics is the study of how people use limited resources to satisfy unlimited wants. Scarcity is the fundamental problem in economics, as there are not enough resources to meet all of people's wants. This forces people to make choices, which involve tradeoffs and opportunity costs.

The factors of production—land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship—are the resources used to produce goods and services. Economies go through cycles of expansion and contraction, which affect businesses and individuals.

In today's interconnected world, economies are increasingly interdependent. Events in one country can affect economies around the world. Understanding these basic economic concepts helps us make better decisions about how to use our limited resources.
