# Lesson 3: Inland Eastern Europe

## The Big Idea
The countries of inland Eastern Europe have varied histories and cultures but face many of the same issues today.

## Main Ideas
- The histories and cultures of inland Eastern Europe vary from country to country.
- Most of inland Eastern Europe faces similar challenges today.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a tourist visiting Budapest, the capital of Hungary. One morning, you stand on a bridge over the glittering water of the Danube River. You read in a guidebook that the two banks of the river were once separate cities. On the bank to your right, you see huge castles and churches standing on a tall hill. To your left is the Parliament building, obviously a much newer building.

**What might have brought the cities together?**

## Diverse Histories and Cultures

Inland Eastern Europe includes several countries located in the interior of the region, away from the Baltic and Mediterranean coasts. These countries include:

- The Czech Republic
- Slovakia
- Hungary
- Belarus
- Ukraine
- Moldova

While these countries share some historical experiences, each has its own unique history and cultural identity.

### The Czech Republic and Slovakia

The Czech Republic and Slovakia were once united as a single country called Czechoslovakia. This country was created after World War I, when the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed. Czechoslovakia was one of the most industrialized and democratic countries in Eastern Europe between the world wars.

During World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the Czech lands (Bohemia and Moravia), while Slovakia became a puppet state allied with Germany. After the war, Czechoslovakia fell under Soviet influence and became a communist state.

In 1989, the "Velvet Revolution" peacefully overthrew the communist government. In 1993, the country peacefully split into two separate nations: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. This division, known as the "Velvet Divorce," was based on cultural and linguistic differences between the Czech and Slovak peoples.

Today, both countries are democracies with growing economies. The Czech Republic, with its capital in Prague, has become particularly successful, with a strong industrial base and thriving tourism industry.

### Hungary

Hungary has a unique history in Eastern Europe. The Hungarian people, or Magyars, arrived in the region around 900 CE. They speak Hungarian, a language unrelated to the Slavic languages spoken by most of their neighbors.

For centuries, Hungary was a powerful kingdom. In the late 1800s, it became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a major European power. After World War I, Hungary lost much of its territory and became a smaller, independent country.

During the Cold War, Hungary was part of the Soviet bloc. In 1956, Hungarians rose up against Soviet control in the Hungarian Revolution, but the uprising was crushed by Soviet troops. Despite this, Hungary developed a somewhat more liberal form of communism than other Soviet bloc countries, allowing some private businesses and greater personal freedoms.

Since the fall of communism in 1989, Hungary has developed a democratic government and market economy. Its capital, Budapest, which was formed by uniting the cities of Buda and Pest on opposite banks of the Danube River, has become a major cultural and economic center.

### Belarus and Ukraine

Belarus and Ukraine were both part of the Russian Empire and later became republics within the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, they became independent countries.

Belarus has maintained close ties with Russia and has a more authoritarian government than most other Eastern European countries. Its economy remains largely state-controlled, similar to the Soviet model.

Ukraine, in contrast, has sought closer ties with Western Europe while also maintaining important economic relationships with Russia. This has sometimes led to tensions, as different political factions in Ukraine favor either Western or Russian alignment. Ukraine is notable for its rich agricultural land, often called the "breadbasket of Europe."

### Moldova

Moldova is a small country between Ukraine and Romania. Historically part of Romania, it was annexed by the Soviet Union during World War II. When Moldova became independent in 1991, a separatist movement in the eastern part of the country led to the creation of Transnistria, a breakaway region that is not internationally recognized but functions as a de facto independent state with Russian support.

Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe, with an economy based largely on agriculture.

## Cultural Diversity

The cultural diversity of inland Eastern Europe reflects the region's complex history.

### Languages

The languages spoken in inland Eastern Europe include:

- **Czech and Slovak**: West Slavic languages that are closely related but distinct
- **Hungarian**: A Finno-Ugric language unrelated to the Slavic languages of neighboring countries
- **Ukrainian and Belarusian**: East Slavic languages related to Russian
- **Romanian**: A Romance language spoken in Moldova

Russian is also widely spoken throughout much of the region, especially among older generations who grew up during the Soviet era.

### Religion

Religion plays an important role in the cultural identity of inland Eastern Europe:

- **Roman Catholicism**: Predominant in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary
- **Eastern Orthodox Christianity**: Predominant in Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova
- **Greek Catholicism**: A significant minority in Ukraine, combining Eastern Orthodox traditions with loyalty to the Pope

Religious practices were suppressed during the communist era but have experienced a revival since the fall of the Soviet Union.

### Cultural Traditions

Despite their differences, the countries of inland Eastern Europe share some cultural traditions:

- **Folk Music and Dance**: Traditional music and dance remain important parts of cultural celebrations
- **Festivals**: Seasonal festivals, many with religious significance
- **Cuisine**: Hearty foods like goulash, cabbage rolls, and dumplings are common throughout the region
- **Crafts**: Traditional crafts such as embroidery, ceramics, and woodcarving are practiced across the region

## Common Challenges Today

Despite their diverse histories and cultures, the countries of inland Eastern Europe face many similar challenges today.

### Political Challenges

After decades of communist rule, these countries have had to develop new political systems. This transition has not always been smooth:

- Building democratic institutions and practices
- Addressing corruption
- Balancing relations with Russia and Western Europe
- Managing ethnic tensions in some areas

### Economic Challenges

The economies of inland Eastern Europe were severely affected by the collapse of the Soviet economic system:

- Outdated industrial infrastructure
- Need for foreign investment
- High unemployment in some areas
- Environmental damage from Soviet-era industry
- Brain drain as educated young people move to Western Europe

### Commonwealth of Independent States

After the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia and several former Soviet republics formed the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This organization was created to maintain economic and political ties among the former Soviet republics.

In inland Eastern Europe, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova joined the CIS. However, Ukraine's relationship with the organization has been complicated by its desire to maintain independence from Russian influence.

### Economic Progress

Despite these challenges, many countries in inland Eastern Europe have made significant economic progress since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Ukraine have been most successful. All four are thriving industrial centers. Ukraine, with rich, productive farmlands, grows grains, potatoes, and sugar beets. Although some factors for a strengthening economy are present, such as high literacy rates and industry, the nations still face many challenges.

### Cities

Life in inland Eastern Europe is centered around cities, especially national capitals. In each country, the capital is both a key economic center and a cultural one.

Three cities in the region are especially importantâ€”Prague, Kiev, and Budapest, the capital of Hungary. They are the most prosperous cities in the region and home to influential leaders and universities. In addition, the cities are popular tourist destinations. People from all over the world visit Eastern Europe to see these cities' architectural and cultural sites.

## Summary

Inland Eastern Europe has a diverse history and culture, with each country having its own unique identity. Despite these differences, the countries share many common challenges as they continue to develop after the fall of the Soviet Union. Many have been successful in building democratic governments and market economies, though challenges remain. The region's cities, particularly Prague, Kiev, and Budapest, have become centers of economic and cultural activity, attracting tourists and investment from around the world.
