# Lesson 4: The Balkan Countries

## The Big Idea
Life in the Balkans reflects the region's troubled past and its varied ethnic makeup.

## Main Ideas
- The history of the Balkan countries is one of conquest and conflict.
- The cultures of the Balkan countries are shaped by the region's diverse ethnic groups.
- The Balkan countries face many challenges today.

## If YOU lived there...
As part of your summer vacation, you are hiking across the Balkan Peninsula. As you hike through villages in the rugged mountains, you are amazed at the different churches you see. There are small Roman Catholic churches, huge Orthodox churches with onion-shaped domes, and Muslim mosques with tall minarets.

**Why are there so many types of churches here?**

## A History of Conquest and Conflict

The Balkan Peninsula, located in southeastern Europe, has a complex history marked by conquest, conflict, and changing borders. The region includes several countries:

- Slovenia
- Croatia
- Bosnia and Herzegovina
- Serbia
- Montenegro
- Kosovo
- North Macedonia
- Albania
- Bulgaria
- Romania
- Greece (partially)

### Early History and Ottoman Rule

For centuries, the Balkan Peninsula was part of the Byzantine Empire, the eastern continuation of the Roman Empire. The Byzantine Empire was centered in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) and was predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christian.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Ottoman Empire, a powerful Muslim state based in what is now Turkey, conquered most of the Balkans. Ottoman rule lasted for about 500 years in many parts of the region. During this period:

- Islam was introduced to the region, though many people maintained their Christian faith
- Local cultures were influenced by Turkish customs and practices
- Some areas, particularly in mountainous regions, maintained significant autonomy

By the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire was weakening, and nationalist movements began to emerge among the various ethnic groups in the Balkans. One by one, different parts of the Balkans gained independence:

- Greece (1830)
- Serbia (1878)
- Romania (1878)
- Bulgaria (1908)

### The Balkan Wars and World War I

The early 20th century saw increased conflict in the Balkans:

1. **The First Balkan War (1912-1913)**: A coalition of Balkan states (Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro, and Serbia) fought against the Ottoman Empire, further reducing Ottoman territory in Europe.

2. **The Second Balkan War (1913)**: Former allies Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia fought over the division of Macedonia.

3. **World War I (1914-1918)**: The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo (now in Bosnia and Herzegovina) triggered a chain of events that led to World War I. The war resulted in the collapse of both the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which had controlled parts of the Balkans.

### Yugoslavia and the Cold War

After World War I, a new country called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed, which was renamed Yugoslavia ("Land of the South Slavs") in 1929. Yugoslavia included:

- Slovenia
- Croatia
- Bosnia and Herzegovina
- Serbia
- Montenegro
- Macedonia (now North Macedonia)

During World War II, Yugoslavia was invaded by Nazi Germany and its allies. After the war, Yugoslavia became a communist state under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito. Unlike other communist countries in Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia maintained independence from the Soviet Union and developed its own form of socialism.

During the Cold War, the Balkan countries were divided:

- Yugoslavia remained independent of Soviet control
- Albania initially allied with the Soviet Union but later with China
- Bulgaria and Romania were part of the Soviet bloc

### The Breakup of Yugoslavia and Recent Conflicts

When communism collapsed across Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Yugoslavia began to break apart along ethnic lines. This led to a series of violent conflicts:

1. **Slovenia and Croatia** declared independence in 1991, leading to brief fighting in Slovenia and a longer war in Croatia.

2. **Bosnia and Herzegovina** declared independence in 1992, resulting in a devastating war (1992-1995) involving Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), Serbs, and Croats. The conflict was marked by ethnic cleansing—the forced removal of ethnic groups from certain areas—and other atrocities.

3. **Kosovo**, a province of Serbia with an Albanian majority, fought for independence in the late 1990s. NATO intervened with airstrikes against Serbia in 1999. Kosovo declared independence in 2008, though not all countries recognize it.

International peacekeeping forces were deployed to maintain stability in the region, and war crimes tribunals were established to prosecute those responsible for atrocities.

## Diverse Cultures

The Balkan Peninsula is one of the most culturally diverse regions in Europe, with numerous ethnic groups, languages, and religions.

### Ethnic Groups

The major ethnic groups in the Balkans include:

- **Slavic peoples**: Slovenes, Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs, Montenegrins, Macedonians, and Bulgarians
- **Albanians**: Primarily in Albania and Kosovo
- **Romanians**: In Romania and Moldova
- **Greeks**: In Greece and Cyprus
- **Turks**: Primarily in parts of Bulgaria, North Macedonia, and Kosovo
- **Roma** (Gypsies): Throughout the region

These ethnic groups often have distinct cultural traditions, though there are also many shared cultural elements across the region.

### Languages

The linguistic diversity of the Balkans reflects its ethnic diversity:

- **South Slavic languages**: Slovenian, Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian, Montenegrin, Macedonian, and Bulgarian
- **Romance languages**: Romanian
- **Albanian**: A unique Indo-European language not closely related to any other
- **Greek**: Another distinct Indo-European language
- **Turkish**: A Turkic language spoken by Turkish minorities

Many of these languages are closely related but use different writing systems. For example, Serbian can be written in both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, while Croatian uses only the Latin alphabet.

### Religions

Religious diversity is another characteristic of the Balkans:

- **Eastern Orthodox Christianity**: Predominant in Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Greece
- **Roman Catholicism**: Predominant in Slovenia and Croatia
- **Islam**: Predominant in Albania and Kosovo, and significant in Bosnia and Herzegovina
- **Judaism**: Small communities throughout the region, though much reduced after the Holocaust

Religious identity often overlaps with ethnic identity. For example, Serbs are typically Orthodox Christians, Croats are typically Roman Catholics, and Bosniaks are typically Muslims, even though they speak very similar languages.

### Cultural Traditions

Despite their differences, the peoples of the Balkans share many cultural traditions:

- **Folk Music and Dance**: Traditional music often features complex rhythms and distinctive vocal styles
- **Cuisine**: Influenced by Turkish, Mediterranean, and Central European traditions
- **Crafts**: Including textiles, ceramics, and metalwork
- **Literature and Poetry**: Rich oral traditions and literary heritage

These shared cultural elements reflect the region's history of cultural exchange and interaction.

## Challenges Today

The Balkan countries face numerous challenges as they continue to recover from the conflicts of the 1990s and transition from communist to democratic systems.

### Political Challenges

Many Balkan countries are working to build stable democratic institutions:

- Addressing corruption and organized crime
- Building independent judiciaries
- Developing effective civil services
- Managing ethnic tensions
- Resolving ongoing territorial disputes

### Economic Challenges

The economies of the Balkan countries face significant challenges:

- High unemployment, especially among young people
- Need for infrastructure development
- Transition from state-controlled to market economies
- Environmental issues from outdated industrial facilities
- Brain drain as educated young people move to Western Europe

### European Integration

Many Balkan countries see membership in the European Union (EU) and NATO as key goals:

- Slovenia and Croatia are already EU members
- Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007
- Other countries are at various stages in the application process
- NATO membership has expanded to include most Balkan countries

EU membership is seen as a path to economic development and political stability, though the process of meeting EU standards is challenging.

### Current Situation in Specific Countries

The countries of the Balkans have had varying degrees of success in addressing these challenges:

- **Slovenia** has been the most successful, with a stable democracy and relatively strong economy.

- **Croatia** has also made significant progress and joined the EU in 2013.

- **Bosnia and Herzegovina** remains divided along ethnic lines, with a complex political system established by the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the war in 1995.

- **Serbia** is working to build democratic institutions while dealing with the loss of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008. Its population is mostly ethnic Albanian.

- **Montenegro** separated peacefully from Serbia in June 2006.

- **Romania**, the largest of the Balkan states, is working to recover from years of bad government. Poor leaders have left its government and economy in ruins.

- **Bulgaria** Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria has changed dramatically. People there are working to develop a capitalist economy based on industry and tourism.

## Summary

The Soviet Union had a huge impact on Eastern Europe. The nations of this region are still working to overcome many challenges today. The Balkan Peninsula has a complex history marked by conquest, conflict, and changing borders. Its diverse ethnic makeup has contributed to both cultural richness and political tensions. Today, the countries of the Balkans face challenges related to democratic development, economic growth, and European integration, though they have made significant progress since the conflicts of the 1990s.
