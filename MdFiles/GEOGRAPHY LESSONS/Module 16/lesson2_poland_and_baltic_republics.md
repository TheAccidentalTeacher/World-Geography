# Lesson 2: Poland and the Baltic Republics

## The Big Idea
The histories of Poland and the Baltic Republics, both as free states and as areas dominated by the Soviet Union, still shape life there.

## Main Ideas
- History ties Poland and the Baltic Republics together.
- The cultures of Poland and the Baltic Republics differ in language and religion but share many customs.
- The economies of Poland and the Baltic Republics are growing stronger since the fall of the Soviet Union.

## If YOU lived there...
You live in the beautiful and historic city of Krakow, Poland. Over the centuries, terrible wars have damaged many Polish cities, but Krakow is filled with cobblestone streets, romantic castles, and elaborate churches. The city is home to one of Europe's oldest shopping malls, the 500-year-old Cloth Hall. Glorious old Catholic churches also rise high above many parts of the city.

## A Shared History

Poland and the Baltic Republics—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—share many historical experiences. Their location on the Northern European Plain has made them vulnerable to invasion throughout history. As a result, these countries have often been dominated by more powerful neighbors.

### Early History

Poland has a long history as an independent state. It first became a unified kingdom in the 900s CE. By the 1500s, Poland had joined with Lithuania to form a powerful state that controlled much of Eastern Europe. This Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was one of the largest and most influential states in Europe.

The Baltic Republics have a more complex early history. Estonia and Latvia were ruled by various powers, including Denmark, Sweden, and Germany. Lithuania, as mentioned, formed a powerful union with Poland.

### Foreign Rule

In the late 1700s, Poland was divided among three powerful neighbors: Russia, Prussia (now part of Germany), and Austria. This division, known as the Partitions of Poland, erased Poland from the map for more than 120 years.

The Baltic Republics also fell under Russian control during this period. The Russian Empire ruled these territories until World War I.

### Independence Between the World Wars

After World War I ended in 1918, Poland and the Baltic Republics gained independence:

- Poland was reestablished as an independent nation.
- Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania became independent countries for the first time in modern history.

This period of independence was short-lived, however. During World War II, these countries were invaded multiple times:

1. In 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed a secret agreement to divide Poland between them.
2. The Soviet Union annexed the Baltic Republics in 1940.
3. Nazi Germany invaded both Poland and the Soviet Union (including the Baltic Republics) in 1941.
4. The Soviet Union regained control of these areas by 1945.

### Soviet Rule

After World War II, Poland and the Baltic Republics came under Soviet control. The Soviet Union established communist governments in these countries and integrated them into its economic system.

Soviet rule brought significant changes:
- Traditional political systems were replaced with communist governments.
- Private businesses were taken over by the state.
- Religious practices were discouraged.
- Russian language and culture were promoted.

Many people in these countries resisted Soviet rule. In Poland, the Solidarity movement, led by Lech Walesa, organized strikes and protests against the communist government in the 1980s.

### Independence Restored

When the Soviet Union began to weaken in the late 1980s, Poland and the Baltic Republics were among the first to break away:

- Poland held partially free elections in 1989, leading to the end of communist rule.
- Lithuania declared independence in March 1990.
- Estonia and Latvia declared independence in August 1991.

Since gaining independence, these countries have worked to establish democratic governments and market economies. All have joined NATO and the European Union, strengthening their ties with Western Europe.

## Diverse Cultures

While Poland and the Baltic Republics share many historical experiences, they have distinct cultural identities.

### Languages

The languages spoken in this region reflect its complex history:

- **Polish**: A West Slavic language using the Latin alphabet, spoken in Poland.
- **Lithuanian**: A Baltic language using the Latin alphabet, one of the oldest Indo-European languages still spoken today.
- **Latvian**: Another Baltic language using the Latin alphabet.
- **Estonian**: A Finno-Ugric language closely related to Finnish, not related to the other languages of the region.

Russian is also widely spoken throughout the region, especially among older generations who grew up during the Soviet era.

### Religion

Religion is an important part of the cultural identity in Poland and the Baltic Republics:

- **Poland**: Predominantly Roman Catholic (about 90% of the population). The Catholic Church played a crucial role in preserving Polish identity during periods of foreign rule and in opposing communist rule.
- **Lithuania**: Mostly Roman Catholic (about 80% of the population).
- **Latvia**: Mixed religious traditions, including Lutheran, Roman Catholic, and Russian Orthodox.
- **Estonia**: One of the least religious countries in Europe, with Lutheran and Orthodox Christian minorities.

### Shared Customs

Despite their differences in language and religion, the people of Poland and the Baltic Republics share many customs:

- **Folk Music and Dance**: Traditional music and dance remain important parts of cultural celebrations.
- **Festivals**: Seasonal festivals, many with pre-Christian origins, are celebrated throughout the region.
- **Cuisine**: Foods like pierogi (filled dumplings), beet soup, and dark rye bread are common throughout the region.
- **Crafts**: Traditional crafts such as amber jewelry, woodcarving, and textile arts are practiced across the region.

These shared customs reflect the region's agricultural heritage and the influence of similar historical experiences.

## Growing Economies

The economies of Poland and the Baltic Republics were severely damaged by World War II and decades of Soviet rule. Under the Soviet system, these countries were forced to focus on heavy industry and collective agriculture, often at the expense of consumer goods and services.

### Economic Challenges

When Soviet rule ended in the early 1990s, these countries faced numerous economic challenges:

- Outdated factories and equipment
- Inefficient agricultural systems
- Limited experience with market economies
- High unemployment
- Environmental damage from Soviet-era industry

### Economic Reforms

To address these challenges, Poland and the Baltic Republics implemented significant economic reforms:

- Privatization of state-owned businesses
- Creation of new banking and financial systems
- Development of legal frameworks for private property and business
- Opening to foreign investment
- Preparation for joining the European Union

These reforms were often difficult and led to short-term hardships, including unemployment and inflation. However, they laid the foundation for long-term economic growth.

### Economic Growth

Today, Poland and the Baltic Republics are working to rebuild and strengthen their economies. They are replacing the old and outdated factories built by the Soviets with new ones that take advantage of modern technology. As a result, cities like Warsaw, the capital of Poland, have become major industrial centers.

To further their economic growth, the countries of this region are also seeking new sources of income. One area in which they have found some success is tourism. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many Americans and Western Europeans have begun visiting. Polish cities like Warsaw and Krakow have long attracted tourists with their rich history and famous sites. Vilnius, Lithuania; Tallinn, Estonia; and Riga, Latvia, have also become tourist attractions. People are drawn to these cities by their fascinating cultures, cool summer climates, and historic sites.

## Summary

Poland and the Baltic Republics are still feeling the effects of decades of Soviet rule. Their shared history of foreign domination, followed by independence, has shaped their national identities. While they have distinct languages and religious traditions, they share many cultural practices. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, these countries have worked to build democratic governments and market economies, finding success despite the challenges they face.
