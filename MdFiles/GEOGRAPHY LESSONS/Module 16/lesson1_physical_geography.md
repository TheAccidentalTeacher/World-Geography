# Lesson 1: Physical Geography of Eastern Europe

## The Big Idea
The physical geography of Eastern Europe varies greatly from place to place.

## Main Ideas
- The physical features of Eastern Europe include wide open plains, rugged mountain ranges, and many rivers.
- Eastern Europe has several different climate zones and types of vegetation.

## If YOU lived there...
You are traveling on a boat down the Danube River, one of the longest in Europe. As you float downstream, you pass through dozens of towns and cities. Outside of the cities, the banks are lined with huge castles, soaring churches, and busy farms. From time to time, other boats pass you, some loaded with passengers and some with goods.

**Why do you think the Danube is so busy?**

## Physical Features of Eastern Europe

Eastern Europe is a region with diverse physical features. It stretches from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south. The region includes several distinct geographical areas, each with its own characteristics.

### The Northern European Plain

The Northern European Plain is a vast, flat area that extends across much of Eastern Europe. This plain begins in France and stretches eastward through Germany, Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine, eventually reaching Russia. The plain is characterized by:

- Gently rolling hills
- Few natural barriers
- Rich, fertile soil ideal for farming
- Numerous rivers that provide transportation routes

The plain's lack of natural barriers has historically made it difficult to defend, contributing to the region's complex political history. Countries in this area have often been invaded by powerful neighbors.

### Mountain Ranges

While much of Eastern Europe consists of plains, the region also features several important mountain ranges:

1. **The Carpathian Mountains**: This range forms a large arc through Central and Eastern Europe, passing through:
   - The Czech Republic
   - Slovakia
   - Poland
   - Ukraine
   - Romania
   
   The Carpathians are home to diverse wildlife, including bears, wolves, and lynx. They also contain valuable natural resources like timber and minerals.

2. **The Balkan Mountains**: Located in the southern part of Eastern Europe, these mountains run through:
   - Bulgaria
   - Serbia
   - North Macedonia
   - Albania
   
   The Balkan Mountains have historically served as barriers between different cultural groups and political entities.

3. **The Dinaric Alps**: These mountains run along the Adriatic coast through:
   - Slovenia
   - Croatia
   - Bosnia and Herzegovina
   - Montenegro
   - Albania

These mountain ranges have played important roles in the region's development by:
- Creating natural borders between countries
- Providing natural resources
- Influencing settlement patterns
- Affecting transportation routes

### Rivers of Eastern Europe

Rivers are vital features of Eastern Europe's geography. They provide:
- Transportation routes
- Water for drinking and irrigation
- Hydroelectric power
- Natural boundaries between countries

The most important rivers in Eastern Europe include:

1. **The Danube River**: The second-longest river in Europe, the Danube flows through or forms borders with ten countries:
   - Germany
   - Austria
   - Slovakia
   - Hungary
   - Croatia
   - Serbia
   - Bulgaria
   - Romania
   - Moldova
   - Ukraine
   
   The Danube has been a crucial transportation route for thousands of years, connecting Eastern Europe to Western Europe and eventually flowing into the Black Sea.

2. **The Vistula River**: Poland's longest river, flowing from the Carpathian Mountains through Warsaw and into the Baltic Sea.

3. **The Dnieper River**: One of Eastern Europe's major waterways, flowing through Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine before emptying into the Black Sea.

4. **The Dniester River**: Flowing through Ukraine and Moldova into the Black Sea.

These rivers have historically served as important trade routes, connecting inland areas to coastal ports and facilitating the exchange of goods and ideas.

## Climate and Vegetation

Eastern Europe experiences several different climate types due to its large size and varied topography.

### The Baltic Coast

The northern part of Eastern Europe along the Baltic Sea has:
- Cool summers
- Cold, snowy winters
- Moderate rainfall throughout the year
- Dense coniferous forests (primarily pine and spruce)

Countries in this region, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and northern Poland, have adapted to these conditions through:
- Forestry industries
- Cold-weather agriculture
- Fishing along the coast
- Winter tourism

### The Interior Plains

The interior plains of Eastern Europe have a continental climate characterized by:
- Hot summers
- Cold winters
- Moderate rainfall, primarily in summer
- Greater temperature extremes than coastal areas

This climate supports:
- Vast forests in the north
- Open grasslands (steppes) in the south
- Rich agricultural land for growing grains, especially wheat

Because of this variation in climate, the plains of Eastern Europe have many types of vegetation. Huge forests cover much of the north. South of these forests are open grassy plains.

Unfortunately, Eastern Europe's forests were greatly damaged by a terrible accident in 1986. A faulty reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine exploded, releasing huge amounts of radiation into the air. This radiation poisoned millions of acres of forest and ruined soil across much of the region.

### The Balkan Coast

Along the Adriatic Sea, the Balkan coast has a Mediterranean climate, with:
- Warm, dry summers
- Mild, rainy winters
- Less rainfall than other parts of Eastern Europe

Because a Mediterranean climate does not bring much rain, the Balkan coast does not have many forests. Instead, the land there is covered by shrubs and hardy trees that do not need much water.

The pleasant climate and beautiful coastline have made this area a popular tourist destination.

## Summary

The landforms of Eastern Europe vary widely, as do its climates and vegetation. The region includes:
- The vast Northern European Plain
- Several major mountain ranges
- Important river systems
- Multiple climate zones

These diverse physical features have influenced settlement patterns, economic activities, and historical developments throughout Eastern Europe.

## Lesson 1 Assessment

### Review Ideas, Terms, and Places

1. **Identify**: What are the major mountain ranges of Eastern Europe?
2. **Make Inferences**: How do you think the physical features of Eastern Europe influence where people live?
3. **Elaborate**: Why is the Danube so important to the people of Eastern Europe?
4. **Describe**: What is the climate of the Balkan Peninsula like?
5. **Explain**: Why are there few trees in the far southern areas of Eastern Europe?
6. **Predict**: How do you think the lingering effects of the Chernobyl accident affect the plant life of Eastern Europe?

### Critical Thinking

**Categorize**: Draw a chart and for each column, identify the landforms, climates, and vegetation of the specific area in Eastern Europe.

| Area | Landforms | Climates | Vegetation |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Baltic coast | | | |
| Interior plains | | | |
| Balkan coast | | | |
