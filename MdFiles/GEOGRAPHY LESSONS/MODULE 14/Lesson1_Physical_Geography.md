# Lesson 1: Physical Geography

## The Big Idea
The peninsulas of Southern Europe have rocky terrains and sunny, mild climates.

## Main Ideas
- Southern Europe's physical features include rugged mountains and narrow coastal plains.
- The region's climate and resources support such industries as agriculture, fishing, and tourism.

## Key Terms and Places
- Mediterranean Sea
- Pyrenees
- Apennines
- Alps
- Mediterranean climate

## If YOU lived there...
You are in a busy fish market in a small town on the coast of Italy, near the Mediterranean Sea. It is early morning. Colorful fishing boats have just pulled into shore with their catch of fresh fish and seafood. They unload their nets of slippery octopus and wriggling shrimp. Others bring silvery sea bass. You are looking forward to lunch—perhaps a tasty fish soup or pasta dish.

## Physical Features

The continent of Europe has often been called a "peninsula of peninsulas." Europe juts out from Asia like one big peninsula. From that one big peninsula, smaller peninsulas extend into the many bodies of water that surround the continent.

Look at the map of Southern Europe. Do you see the three large peninsulas that extend south from Europe? From west to east, these are the Iberian Peninsula, the Italian Peninsula, and the Balkan Peninsula. Together with some large islands, they form the region of Southern Europe. Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal are countries in Southern Europe.

Southern Europe is also known as Mediterranean Europe. Many of the countries of Southern Europe have long coastlines on the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to this common location on the Mediterranean, the countries of Southern Europe share many common physical features.

### Landforms

The three peninsulas of Southern Europe are largely covered with rugged mountains. In Greece, for example, mountains cover about 80 percent of the land. The mountains of Southern Europe are part of the Alpine Mountain System, which stretches across Europe from Spain to the Balkans.

The Pyrenees (PIHR-uh-neez) form a natural border between Spain and France. The Apennines (AP-uh-nynz) run the length of the Italian Peninsula. The Alps, Europe's highest mountains, stretch across northern Italy. The mountains of Greece are an extension of the Alps.

The mountains of Southern Europe are steep and rocky. In many places, they drop directly into the sea. In other places, narrow coastal plains lie between the mountains and the sea. These plains are the main areas of settlement in the region.

Southern Europe also includes several large islands in the Mediterranean Sea. The largest of these islands are Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Crete, and Cyprus. Like the peninsulas, these islands are mountainous.

### Bodies of Water

The Mediterranean Sea is the most important body of water in Southern Europe. The Mediterranean is almost completely surrounded by land. It is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by the narrow Strait of Gibraltar. It is connected to the Black Sea by two narrow waterways, the Dardanelles and the Bosporus.

The Mediterranean has been important to the people of Southern Europe for thousands of years. It has provided them with food, transportation routes, and a moderate climate. The sea has also served as a link between Europe, Africa, and Asia. For centuries, ships have carried goods and ideas across the Mediterranean, connecting the cultures of three continents.

Other important bodies of water in Southern Europe include the Adriatic Sea, the Ionian Sea, and the Aegean Sea. These are all parts of the Mediterranean. The Adriatic Sea separates Italy from the Balkan Peninsula. The Ionian Sea lies between Italy and Greece. The Aegean Sea lies between Greece and Turkey.

Southern Europe has relatively few major rivers. The Po River in northern Italy and the Ebro River in Spain are the largest. These rivers provide water for irrigation and transportation.

## Climate and Resources

Southern Europe has a Mediterranean climate. This climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The Mediterranean climate is found in only a few other places in the world, including parts of California, Chile, South Africa, and Australia.

The Mediterranean climate is ideal for growing certain crops, such as olives, grapes, citrus fruits, and wheat. These crops have been staples of the Southern European diet for thousands of years.

### Climate Factors

Several factors influence the climate of Southern Europe. One is the Mediterranean Sea itself. The sea moderates temperatures in the region, keeping coastal areas cooler in summer and warmer in winter than inland areas.

Another factor is the mountains. The mountains of Southern Europe block cold air from the north, helping to keep the region mild in winter. The mountains also affect rainfall patterns. When moist air from the Mediterranean moves inland and rises over the mountains, it cools and releases its moisture as rain or snow. This process, called orographic precipitation, provides water for the region's rivers and crops.

A third factor is the region's latitude. Southern Europe lies between 35° and 45° north latitude, placing it in the middle latitudes. This location gives the region moderate temperatures and distinct seasons.

### Natural Resources

Southern Europe has limited natural resources. The region has few mineral resources, although there are some deposits of coal, iron ore, and bauxite (used to make aluminum). The mountainous terrain makes farming difficult in many areas.

Despite these limitations, the people of Southern Europe have made good use of the resources they do have. The Mediterranean climate allows them to grow a variety of crops, especially in the coastal plains and river valleys. The sea provides fish and seafood. The mountains, with their dramatic scenery, attract tourists. And the region's location at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and Asia has made it an important center of trade and cultural exchange.

### Economic Activities

The physical geography of Southern Europe has shaped the region's economic activities. Agriculture has traditionally been important, especially in the coastal plains and river valleys. Farmers grow olives, grapes, citrus fruits, and wheat. They also raise sheep and goats in the mountainous areas.

Fishing is another important industry, especially in coastal communities. The Mediterranean Sea provides a variety of fish and seafood, including tuna, sardines, anchovies, and squid.

Tourism is a major industry in Southern Europe. Millions of visitors come each year to enjoy the region's sunny climate, beautiful beaches, historic sites, and cultural attractions. Tourism provides jobs and income for many people in the region.

Manufacturing is less developed in Southern Europe than in northern Europe, but it is growing in importance. The region produces textiles, food products, automobiles, and other goods. Many factories are located in the coastal plains and river valleys, where transportation is easier.

## Conclusion

The physical geography of Southern Europe has played a crucial role in shaping the region's history, culture, and economy. The mountainous terrain has isolated communities and preserved local traditions. The Mediterranean Sea has connected the region to other parts of the world and influenced its climate, diet, and way of life. Despite limited natural resources, the people of Southern Europe have built thriving societies that have made significant contributions to world civilization.
