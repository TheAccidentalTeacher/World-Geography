## If YOU lived there...
You have just moved to southern Spain from a town in the far north. You cannot help noticing that many of the buildings here look different from those in your hometown. Many of the buildings here have rounded arches over the doorways and tall towers in front of them. In addition, some are decorated with ornate tiles.

**Why do you think the buildings look different?**

## History

Locate Spain and Portugal on the physical map. As you can see, the two countries share the Iberian Peninsula, or Iberia, the westernmost peninsula in Europe. Although the two are different in many ways, they share a common history.

Across the centuries, several powerful empires controlled all or part of the Iberian Peninsula. By 700 BC the Phoenicians, from the eastern Mediterranean, had colonized coastal areas of what is now Spain. After the Phoenicians came the Greeks. A few centuries later, all of Iberia became part of the Roman Empire.

After the Roman Empire fell apart, Iberia was invaded by the Moors, a group of Muslims from North Africa. For about 600 years, much of the Iberian Peninsula was under Muslim rule.

By the end of the 1400s, however, the Muslims were driven out of Iberia. The rulers of the Christian kingdoms of Spain and Portugal banded together to force non-Christians to leave or convert to Christianity.

Spain and Portugal went on to build large empires that spanned the oceans. Both countries ruled huge territories in the Americas as well as smaller areas in Africa and Asia. These territories made the two kingdoms rich and powerful until most of their colonies broke away and became independent in the 1800s and 1900s.

## Culture

In some ways, the cultures of Spain and Portugal are like those of other Southern European countries. For example, the Spanish, Portuguese, Greeks, and Italians all cook with many of the same ingredients. The Catholic Church is very influential in Italy as well as Spain and Portugal. In other ways, Iberian cultures are unique.

### Language

The most spoken languages in Iberia are, of course, Spanish and Portuguese. Various dialects of these languages are spoken in different parts of the peninsula. In addition, other languages are also spoken by many people in Iberia. The Catalan language of eastern Spain is similar to Spanish. Galician, which is spoken in northwest Spain, is more closely related to Portuguese.

In addition, the Basque (BASK) people of the Pyrenees have their own language, which is not related to either Spanish or Portuguese. The Basques also have their own customs and traditions, unlike those of the rest of Spain. As a result, many Basques have long wanted to form their own independent country.

### Religion

Most people in both Spain and Portugal are Roman Catholic. People in both countries celebrate Christian holidays like Christmas and Easter. In addition, many towns hold fiestas, or festivals, in honor of their patron saints. At these festivals, people may gather to dance or to watch a bullfight.

### Music and Art

Music and art have been central to Iberian culture for centuries. The Portuguese are famous for sad folk songs called fados. The Spanish are known for a style of song and dance called flamenco.

Many elements of Iberia's art and architecture reflect its Muslim past. Many buildings in the peninsula have elements of Muslim design, such as round arches and elaborate tilework.

## Spain and Portugal Today

Compared to most other countries in Western Europe, Spain's and Portugal's economies are struggling. Their economic problems were caused by recent hardships and by past events.

### Challenge of the Past

Spain and Portugal were once Europe's richest countries. Their wealth came from gold and silver found in their colonies. When other countries in Europe began to build industrial economies, Spain and Portugal continued to rely on gold from their colonies. As those colonies became independent, that source of income was lost. As a result, Spain and Portugal were late in developing manufacturing.

All Southern European countries are now members of the European Union (EU). The EU is an organization formed to increase economic and political cooperation among its members. One of the EU's actions was to get rid of trade barriers. This action supported the expansion of global markets. By joining the EU, Spain and Portugal aimed to increase their trade and improve their economies. However, Spain and Portugal are still poorer than other countries in Western Europe. Despite recent economic growth and vibrant industries such as tourism, their economies are struggling.

### Government

Both Spain and Portugal are parliamentary monarchies. In this type of government, a king or queen serves as head of state, but elected officials actually run the government. The prime minister is the head of the government and is usually the leader of the political party that has the most members in the parliament.

Spain's current king, Felipe VI, became king in 2014 when his father, Juan Carlos I, stepped down. Portugal's monarchy was overthrown in 1910, and the country became a republic. However, Portugal was ruled by a dictator from 1932 to 1968. Since 1976, Portugal has been a democracy.

### Cities

The capital and largest city of Spain is Madrid, located in the center of the country. Madrid is a modern city with a population of about 3.2 million people. It is the political, economic, and cultural center of Spain. The city has many museums, theaters, and other cultural attractions.

Barcelona is Spain's second-largest city and a major port on the Mediterranean Sea. It is known for its unique architecture, especially the works of Antoni Gaudí. Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, a region with its own language and culture. Many Catalans want more autonomy or even independence from Spain.

Lisbon is the capital and largest city of Portugal. Like Barcelona, it is a port city on the Atlantic Ocean. Lisbon has a rich history and culture, with influences from the many civilizations that have ruled the area over the centuries.

### Economy

Both Spain and Portugal have mixed economies, with a combination of private enterprise and government involvement. Agriculture is still important, especially in rural areas. Major crops include olives, grapes, citrus fruits, and cork (in Portugal). Spain and Portugal are also major wine producers.

Tourism is a vital industry for both countries. Millions of visitors come each year to enjoy the sunny climate, beautiful beaches, historic sites, and cultural attractions. Tourism provides jobs and income for many people in the region.

Manufacturing and services are growing sectors of the economy. Spain produces automobiles, textiles, food products, and other goods. Portugal has traditionally been known for textiles and footwear, but is now developing other industries as well.

Despite these economic activities, both countries face challenges. Unemployment is high, especially among young people. Many educated Spaniards and Portuguese have left their countries to find better opportunities elsewhere. Both countries also have significant government debt, which limits their ability to invest in infrastructure and social programs.

## Focus on Culture: Flamenco

Complex guitar rhythms, a heavy beat, and whirling dancers—these are all part of the traditional Spanish art form known as flamenco. The word flamenco refers both to a style of music and a style of dance. The most important instrument in the music is the guitar, which was itself a Spanish invention. Most of the time, the guitar is accompanied by other musical instruments and by singers.

When most people think of flamenco, however, they picture dancers. Flamenco dancers perform alone, in pairs, or in large groups. They wear brightly colored costumes as they perform complex steps. It is not unusual for dancers to clap their hands or snap their fingers to the beat or to play castanets as they dance.

Flamenco originated in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia. It was influenced by the music and dance of the Roma people (sometimes called Gypsies) who settled there, as well as by the region's Moorish heritage. Today, flamenco is considered an important part of Spanish cultural identity and is performed around the world.

## Conclusion

Spain and Portugal, with their rich histories, diverse cultures, and beautiful landscapes, are important parts of Southern Europe. Despite economic challenges, they continue to contribute to European and global culture through their art, music, literature, and cuisine. As members of the European Union, they are working to strengthen their economies and improve the lives of their citizens. Their experiences show how a region's past can shape its present and future, and how people can create vibrant societies even in the face of difficulties.
