# Lesson 2: Mainland Southeast Asia

## The Big Idea
The mainland countries of Southeast Asia share many cultural influences but have distinct histories and governments.

## Main Ideas
- The countries of mainland Southeast Asia have been shaped by powerful neighbors, colonialism, and war.
- Most mainland Southeast Asian countries have agricultural economies, but some are developing industries.
- The countries of mainland Southeast Asia face environmental challenges and political issues.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a young person living in Vietnam. Your parents and grandparents lived through difficult times during the Vietnam War. Now your country is at peace, and the economy is growing. Your family has a small business making clothing. Recently, a big foreign company has offered to buy cloth from your family's business. This could mean more money, but also more work.

**How might this opportunity change your family's life?**
