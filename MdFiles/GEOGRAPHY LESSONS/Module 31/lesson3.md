# Lesson 3: Island Southeast Asia Today

## The Big Idea
The island nations of Southeast Asia are diverse in culture and face both challenges and opportunities in the modern world.

## Main Ideas
- The island nations of Southeast Asia have diverse populations and histories.
- These nations have developing economies based on agriculture, manufacturing, and services.
- Island Southeast Asian nations face challenges including natural disasters, political instability, and economic inequality.

## If YOU lived there...
You live on a small island in Indonesia. Your family has fished these waters for generations. Recently, large commercial fishing boats from other countries have been coming to your area. They use huge nets that catch many more fish than your small boat can. You worry that soon there will not be enough fish left for your family to make a living.

**What options might your family have in this situation?**

## Economic Development

Island Southeast Asia displays diverse levels of economic development, from Singapore's advanced economy to East Timor's struggling development.

### Economic Models and Strategies

#### Resource-Based Development
Many island economies initially relied on natural resources:
- Indonesia's oil, gas, minerals, and timber
- Brunei's petroleum and natural gas
