## If YOU lived there...
You and your friends are planning to hike up Mount Kilimanjaro, near the equator in Tanzania. It is hot in your camp at the base of the mountain. You're wearing shorts and a T-shirt, but your guide tells you to pack a fleece jacket and jeans. You start your climb, and soon you understand this advice. The air is much colder, and there's snow on the nearby peaks.

## Physical Features

East and Southern Africa is a vast region with diverse physical features that have shaped its history, culture, and development. The region includes countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Madagascar.

### The Great Rift Valley

One of the most distinctive physical features of East Africa is the Great Rift Valley. This enormous geological formation is part of a larger rift system that extends from Syria in Southwest Asia to Mozambique in Southern Africa, covering a distance of about 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers).

The Great Rift Valley formed millions of years ago when the Earth's crust began to split apart. As the land pulled apart, the central section dropped down, creating a long, deep valley bordered by steep cliffs. This process is still ongoing, and eventually, the rift may widen enough to allow the Indian Ocean to flood in, separating East Africa from the rest of the continent.

The Great Rift Valley has several branches in East Africa:
- The Eastern Rift Valley, which runs through Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania
- The Western Rift Valley, which contains Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi

The rift valley system has created a variety of landforms, including:
- Deep valleys with steep walls
- Volcanic mountains
- Numerous lakes
- Hot springs and geysers

The volcanic activity associated with the rift has created fertile soil in many areas, making them suitable for agriculture. The rift valley lakes, such as Lake Turkana in Kenya and Lake Tanganyika (which borders Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, and Zambia), provide water resources and support fishing communities.

### Mountains and Highlands

East and Southern Africa are home to several significant mountain ranges and highland areas:

**Mount Kilimanjaro** in Tanzania is the highest mountain in Africa, with an elevation of 19,341 feet (5,895 meters). Despite being near the equator, its peak is covered with snow and glaciers due to its high elevation. However, these glaciers are shrinking due to climate change.

**The Ethiopian Highlands** form the largest continuous area of high elevation in Africa. This massive plateau is divided by the Great Rift Valley and includes peaks over 14,000 feet (4,300 meters) high. The highlands have a cooler climate than surrounding lowlands and receive more rainfall, making them suitable for agriculture.

**The Drakensberg Mountains** in South Africa and Lesotho form a dramatic escarpment that separates the high plateau of the interior from the coastal lowlands. The highest peak, Thabana Ntlenyana in Lesotho, reaches 11,424 feet (3,482 meters).

**The Central Plateau** of Southern Africa covers much of South Africa, Zimbabwe, and parts of neighboring countries. This high plateau, known as the Highveld in South Africa, has elevations ranging from 4,000 to 6,000 feet (1,200 to 1,800 meters) and is rich in mineral resources.

### Plains and Savannas

Between the mountains and highlands are extensive plains and savannas:

**The Serengeti Plain** in Tanzania and Kenya is one of the most famous grassland ecosystems in the world. It covers about 12,000 square miles (30,000 square kilometers) and is home to the largest terrestrial mammal migration on Earth, involving millions of wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles.

**The Masai Mara** in Kenya is the northern extension of the Serengeti ecosystem and is renowned for its wildlife, particularly during the annual migration.

**The Kalahari Basin** in Southern Africa covers parts of Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa. It is not a true desert but rather a semi-arid savanna with seasonal rainfall that supports a variety of plant and animal life.

### Rivers and Lakes

East and Southern Africa have several major river systems and lakes:

**The Nile River**, the world's longest river, has its source in the highlands of East Africa. The White Nile originates from Lake Victoria, while the Blue Nile flows from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands. These two branches meet in Sudan before flowing north to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.

**The Zambezi River** is the fourth-longest river in Africa and flows through six countries before emptying into the Indian Ocean. Along its course, it forms Victoria Falls, one of the largest waterfalls in the world, and Lake Kariba, a large artificial lake created by the Kariba Dam.

**Lake Victoria** is the largest lake in Africa and the second-largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area. It is shared by Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya and is a vital resource for fishing, transportation, and water supply.

**Lake Tanganyika** is the world's second-deepest lake and the longest freshwater lake. It is known for its unique ecosystem and high biodiversity, with hundreds of species found nowhere else on Earth.

**Lake Malawi** (also called Lake Nyasa) is the third-largest lake in Africa and is renowned for its clear waters and extraordinary diversity of fish species, particularly cichlids.

### Coastal Areas and Islands

East and Southern Africa have extensive coastlines along the Indian Ocean:

**The East African Coast** stretches from Somalia to Mozambique and includes coral reefs, mangrove forests, and sandy beaches. Historic port cities like Mombasa (Kenya) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) are located along this coast.

**Madagascar**, the world's fourth-largest island, lies off the southeast coast of Africa. It separated from the African mainland about 160 million years ago, allowing unique plant and animal species to evolve in isolation. About 90 percent of Madagascar's wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth.

**The Cape of Good Hope** at the southern tip of Africa is where the Atlantic and Indian Oceans meet. This area has a unique ecosystem known as the Cape Floral Kingdom, which contains thousands of plant species found nowhere else in the world.

## Climate and Vegetation

East and Southern Africa experience a wide range of climates due to factors such as latitude, elevation, ocean currents, and prevailing winds. These varied climates support diverse vegetation types.

### Tropical Climates

Areas near the equator in East Africa have tropical climates:

**Tropical Rainforest Climate**: Found in parts of Uganda, Rwanda, and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. These areas receive high rainfall throughout the year and support dense, multi-layered forests with high biodiversity.

**Tropical Monsoon Climate**: Common in coastal areas of East Africa, with distinct wet and dry seasons. The vegetation includes monsoon forests that shed some leaves during the dry season.

**Tropical Savanna Climate**: Prevalent across much of East Africa, with a pronounced dry season. This climate supports grasslands with scattered trees, known as savannas, which are home to the region's famous wildlife.

### Highland Climates

The highlands and mountains of East and Southern Africa have cooler climates due to their elevation:

**Highland Climate**: Areas like the Ethiopian Highlands and parts of Kenya have moderate temperatures year-round despite their tropical latitude. These regions are often described as having "eternal spring" and support agriculture without the extreme heat found at lower elevations.

**Alpine Climate**: At the highest elevations, such as on Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya, temperatures can drop below freezing, especially at night. These areas have sparse vegetation adapted to cold conditions, and the highest peaks are covered with snow and glaciers.

### Arid and Semi-Arid Climates

Many parts of East and Southern Africa have dry climates:

**Desert Climate**: The Namib Desert along the coast of Namibia is one of the oldest and driest deserts in the world. Despite receiving very little rainfall, it supports unique adapted species like the welwitschia plant, which can live for over 1,000 years.

**Semi-Arid Climate**: Found in areas like the Kalahari Basin and parts of Kenya and Tanzania. These regions receive limited seasonal rainfall and support drought-resistant vegetation such as acacia trees and various grasses.

### Mediterranean Climate

The southwestern tip of South Africa has a Mediterranean climate, with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. This climate supports the unique fynbos vegetation of the Cape Floral Kingdom, which includes proteas, ericas, and other distinctive plant species.

### Vegetation Zones

The diverse climates of East and Southern Africa support several major vegetation zones:

**Tropical Rainforests**: Found in areas with high rainfall near the equator, particularly in parts of Uganda, Rwanda, and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. These forests have high biodiversity but cover a relatively small portion of the region.

**Montane Forests**: Occur at higher elevations in East Africa, with different forest types at different altitudes. These forests are important watersheds and habitats for unique species.

**Savannas**: The most extensive vegetation type in the region, consisting of grasslands with scattered trees. The savannas support the region's famous wildlife, including large herbivores like elephants, giraffes, and various antelope species, as well as predators like lions and cheetahs.

**Thornbush and Scrubland**: Found in drier areas, with drought-resistant, often thorny vegetation adapted to limited rainfall and poor soils.

**Desert Vegetation**: In the driest areas, such as the Namib Desert, plants have extreme adaptations for water conservation, including deep roots, small leaves, and specialized water storage tissues.

**Fynbos**: A unique vegetation type found in the Cape region of South Africa, characterized by small-leaved, evergreen shrubs adapted to the Mediterranean climate and poor soils. The fynbos is known for its exceptional plant diversity.

## Natural Resources

East and Southern Africa are rich in natural resources, which have played a significant role in the region's economic development and, in some cases, contributed to conflicts.

### Water Resources

Water is a vital resource in East and Southern Africa, though its distribution is uneven:

**Rivers and Lakes**: Major rivers like the Nile, Zambezi, and Limpopo provide water for drinking, irrigation, and hydroelectric power. Lakes such as Victoria, Tanganyika, and Malawi are important for fishing, transportation, and tourism.

**Groundwater**: In drier areas, groundwater is a crucial resource for human settlements and agriculture. However, overuse and pollution threaten this resource in some areas.

**Hydroelectric Power**: The region's rivers have significant potential for hydroelectric power generation. Major dams include the Kariba Dam on the Zambezi River (between Zambia and Zimbabwe) and the Aswan High Dam on the Nile in Egypt.

### Mineral Resources

East and Southern Africa have abundant mineral resources:

**Gold**: South Africa has been one of the world's leading gold producers for over a century, though production has declined in recent decades. Gold is also mined in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and other countries in the region.

**Diamonds**: Botswana is one of the world's largest diamond producers, and diamonds are also mined in South Africa, Namibia, and Angola. The diamond industry is a major contributor to these countries' economies.

**Platinum Group Metals**: South Africa is the world's largest producer of platinum, which is used in catalytic converters, electronics, and jewelry.

**Copper**: Zambia has significant copper deposits and has been a major producer for decades. The copper industry is central to Zambia's economy.

**Other Minerals**: The region also has deposits of chromium, cobalt, uranium, iron ore, coal, and many other minerals.

### Energy Resources

In recent years, significant discoveries of gas and oil resources have been made in East and Southern Africa. In 2012, one of the world's largest natural gas deposits was discovered in Mozambique. Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya are also rich in gas and oil resources.

Southern Africa is abundant in other natural resources as well. Madagascar's forests provide timber. The region's most valuable resources, however, are minerals. Mines in South Africa produce most of the world's gold. In addition, South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia have productive diamond mines. Other mineral resources in Southern Africa include coal, platinum, copper, uranium, and iron ore. Although mining is very important to regional economies, the mines and the pollution they produce have damaging effects on surrounding natural environments.
