# Lesson 2: China

## If YOU lived there...
Long ago, your family owned a small farm in the countryside. But, in the 1950s, China's government took over people's farms to create large government-run farms. For years, your parents grew tea on a government farm. Since the government began allowing private businesses, your parents have been selling tea in the market. Now, they are considering opening a tea shop.

**What do you think your parents should do?**

## Modern History

In 1644 an ethnic group called the Manchu from northeastern Asia took control of China and founded the Qing (CHING) dynasty. Qing rule was peaceful until the 1800s. At that time, European powers began spreading their empires into Asia. Much of China fell under European influence. At the same time, many Chinese wanted to end dynastic rule. This unhappiness sparked a revolution.

### Revolution and Civil War

In 1911 a revolution ended 2,000 years of rule by emperors. The rebels founded a republic, a political system in which voters elect their leaders. Two rival political groups soon emerged—the Nationalists, led by Chiang Kai-shek (chang ky-SHEK), and the Communists, led by Mao Zedong (MOW ZUH DOOHNG). The Nationalists wanted China to remain a republic based on democracy. The Communists believed that communism was the best political and economic system for China.

The two groups fought a bloody civil war. That war ended in October 1949 with the Communists as victors. They founded a new government, the People's Republic of China. The Nationalists fled to Taiwan, where they founded the Republic of China.

### Communist Rule

After taking power, Mao and the Communists made major changes to China's economy. They took over factories and farms. They also created a command economy, in which the government makes all economic decisions. The government decided what goods to produce, what prices to charge, and what jobs people would do.

Mao also tried to modernize China's economy. In 1958 he launched the Great Leap Forward. This program was intended to increase farm and factory output. However, it was poorly planned and led to a terrible famine in which millions of Chinese died.

In 1966 Mao began the Cultural Revolution. During this period, he tried to eliminate China's traditional culture and values. He closed schools and sent young people to work in the countryside. He also had people who disagreed with him arrested or killed. The Cultural Revolution ended when Mao died in 1976.

### China Today

After Mao's death, China's leaders began to change the country's economic policies. They allowed some private businesses and foreign investment. These changes helped China's economy grow rapidly. However, the government continued to restrict political freedom.

In 1989 thousands of Chinese gathered in Beijing's Tiananmen Square to demand democracy. The government responded by sending in troops and tanks. Hundreds of protesters were killed.

Today, China's government continues to limit political freedom. It restricts free speech and controls the media. It also limits religious freedom. In Tibet, a region in western China, the government has tried to eliminate Tibetan Buddhism and culture. Many Tibetans have fled to other countries.

## Economy

China has one of the world's fastest-growing economies. It is based on both agriculture and manufacturing.

### Agriculture

About half of China's workers are farmers. They grow rice, wheat, potatoes, and other crops. China is the world's largest producer of rice. Most farms are small and are worked by hand or with simple tools. However, some large farms use modern equipment.

### Manufacturing and Trade

China has become a major manufacturing center. It produces clothing, toys, electronics, and many other goods. Many of these goods are exported to other countries. China's largest trading partners are the United States, Japan, and South Korea.

China's economic growth has been centered in its eastern coastal cities. Shanghai is China's largest city and a major port. It is a center of finance, trade, and manufacturing. Hong Kong, which was returned to China by Great Britain in 1997, is another important economic center.

## Population

China has the world's largest population—about 1.4 billion people. Most Chinese live in the eastern part of the country, where the land is suitable for farming. Western China is mostly desert and mountains, so few people live there.

China's population has grown rapidly in recent decades. To slow this growth, the government introduced a one-child policy in 1979. This policy limited most families to having only one child. The policy was controversial and was ended in 2015.

China's cities are growing rapidly as people move from rural areas to find jobs. About half of China's people now live in cities. Beijing, the capital, has more than 21 million people. Other major cities include Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.

## Environment

China's rapid economic growth has caused serious environmental problems.

### Air and Water Pollution

China's factories and power plants burn large amounts of coal, which causes severe air pollution. Many Chinese cities have smog so thick that people can barely see. This pollution causes respiratory diseases and other health problems.

China's water is also polluted. Many factories dump waste into rivers and lakes. The Chang Jiang (Yangtze River) is one of the world's most polluted rivers. This pollution harms fish and other wildlife and makes the water unsafe to drink.

### Other Environmental Challenges

China faces other environmental challenges as well. Deforestation is a problem in many areas. As trees are cut down, soil erosion increases. This can lead to flooding and landslides.

Desertification is another problem. In northern China, the Gobi Desert is expanding as grasslands are overgrazed and trees are cut down. This threatens farmland and forces people to move.

Today China's government is taking steps to combat pollution. In addition to wind and solar power, China is investing in hydroelectric power, electricity produced from dams. China has built the Three Gorges Dam on the Chang Jiang. It is the world's largest dam and generates as much power as 15 coal-burning power plants. However, the water of the dam's reservoir now covers hundreds of towns and huge amounts of farmland. Millions of people have had to move, and plant and animal habitats have been harmed.

## Culture

### Ethnic Groups and Language

Of China's millions of people, 92 percent identify their ancestry as Han Chinese. These people share the same culture and traditions. Many Han speak Mandarin, one of China's official languages. Others speak a dialect, a regional version of a language.

Some 55 other ethnic groups make up the remaining 8 percent of China's population. Most minority groups live in western and southern China, where they have their own distinct cultures.

### Religion, Values, and Beliefs

Ancient religions, values, and beliefs shape life for China's many people, even though the Communist government discourages the practice of religion. China's two main belief systems are Daoism (DOW-i-zuhm) and Buddhism. Daoism stresses living simply and in harmony with nature. It takes its name from the word Dao, which means "the way."

Buddhism came to China from India about AD 100. This religion is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama—the Buddha, who lived from 563 to 483 BC. Buddhists believe moral behavior, kindness, and meditation can lead to peace. Many Chinese blend elements of Daoism and Buddhism with Confucianism, a philosophy based on the ideas and teachings of Confucius. This philosophy stresses the importance of family, moral values, and respect for one's elders.

Other major religions in China include Christianity and Islam. Ancestor worship and fortune telling are popular among the Chinese as well.

### Art and Popular Culture

China has a rich artistic tradition. Traditional Chinese crafts include items made of bronze, jade, ivory, silk, or wood. Chinese porcelain, which the ancient Chinese developed, is highly prized for its quality and beauty.

Starting as early as age 6, many young Chinese memorize up to several hundred martial arts movements. These movements include different kicks, jumps, and punches.

Traditional Chinese painting is done on silk or fine paper and reflects a focus on balance and harmony with nature. Chinese art often includes calligraphy, or decorative writing. Chinese writing uses symbols, or characters, instead of letters. This writing makes beautiful art, and some paintings feature just calligraphy.

In literature, the Chinese are known for poetry, and poems appear on paintings and in novels and plays. In theater, traditional Chinese opera is popular. These operas tell stories through spoken words, music, and dance. Actors wear elaborate costumes and makeup that have special meanings.

Traditional Chinese architecture features wooden buildings on stone bases. Large tiled roofs curve upward at the edge. Also common are pagodas, Buddhist temples that have multi-storied towers with an upward curving roof at each floor.

Popular culture includes many activities. Popular sports are martial arts and table tennis. A popular game is mah-jongg, played with small tiles. People also enjoy karaoke clubs, where they sing to music.

## Summary and Preview
China is undergoing great economic and social change. Still its government restricts freedom and faces environmental challenges. In the next lesson you will learn about Mongolia and Taiwan.
