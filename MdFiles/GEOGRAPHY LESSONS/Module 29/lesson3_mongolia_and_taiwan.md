# Lesson 3: Mongolia and Taiwan

## If YOU lived there...
Like many Mongolians, you have loved horses since you were a small child. You live in an apartment in the city of Ulaanbaatar, however. Some of your family are talking about leaving the city and becoming nomadic herders like your ancestors were. You think you might like being able to ride horses more. You're not sure you would like living in a tent, though, especially in winter.

**Do you want to move back to the land?**

## The Big Idea
Mongolia is a rugged land with a nomadic way of life and growing cities, while Taiwan is a densely settled and industrialized island.

## Main Ideas
- Mongolia is a sparsely populated country where many people live as nomads.
- Taiwan is a small island with a dense population and a highly industrialized economy.

## Key Terms and Places
- gers
- Ulaanbaatar
- Taipei
- Kao-hsiung

## Mongolia

A wild and rugged land, Mongolia is home to the Mongol people. They have a proud and fascinating history. This history includes conquests and empires and a culture that prizes horses.

### Mongolia's History

Today when people discuss the world's leading countries, they do not mention Mongolia. However, 700 years ago Mongolia was perhaps the greatest power in the world. Led by the ruler Genghis Khan, the Mongols conquered much of Asia, including China. Later Mongol leaders continued the conquests. They built the greatest empire the world had seen at the time.

The Mongol Empire reached its height in the late 1200s. During that time, the empire stretched from Europe's Danube River in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east. As time passed, however, the Mongol Empire declined. In the late 1600s China conquered Mongolia and ruled it for more than 200 years.

With Russia's help, Mongolia declared independence from China in 1911. Soon Communists gained control and in 1924 formed the Mongolian People's Republic. Meanwhile, Russia had become part of the Soviet Union, a large Communist country north of Mongolia. The Soviet Union strongly influenced Mongolia and gave it large amounts of economic aid. This aid ended, however, after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Since then, Mongolians have struggled to build a democratic government and a free-market economy.

### Land and Climate

Mongolia is a landlocked country in central Asia. It is about the size of Alaska. Mongolia's landscape includes mountains, forests, and grasslands. The Gobi Desert covers much of southern Mongolia. This desert is one of the world's harshest environments. It has extreme temperatures, with very hot summers and bitterly cold winters.

Mongolia's climate is harsh. Winters are long and extremely cold, with temperatures often dropping to -40°F (-40°C). Summers are short and can be hot. Rainfall is limited, especially in the Gobi Desert.

### People and Culture

Mongolia has a small population—only about 3 million people. This makes it one of the world's most sparsely populated countries. About half of Mongolia's people live in cities and towns. The rest live in rural areas, many as nomads.

Nomads move from place to place with their herds of animals. Mongolian nomads raise sheep, goats, cattle, horses, and camels. They live in gers (GEHRZ), which are large, round tents made of felt. Gers can be taken down and moved easily, which is important for people who move frequently.

Horses are central to Mongolian culture. Mongolians are known as excellent riders. Children learn to ride at a young age. Horses provide transportation and are used to herd other animals. They are also a source of milk, which is used to make cheese and a fermented drink called airag.

Mongolia's capital and largest city is Ulaanbaatar (OO-lahn-BAH-tuhr). About 45 percent of Mongolia's people live there. The city has grown rapidly in recent years as nomads have moved there seeking jobs and a better life. This growth has led to overcrowding and pollution.

Mongolia's economy is based largely on mining and agriculture. The country has rich deposits of coal, copper, and gold. Mining has helped Mongolia's economy grow in recent years. However, many Mongolians remain poor.

## Taiwan

Taiwan is an island about 100 miles (161 km) off the coast of mainland China. It is about the size of Maryland and Delaware combined. Despite its small size, Taiwan has a large population and a strong economy.

### Taiwan's History

Taiwan's history is closely tied to China's. Chinese settlers began moving to the island in the 1600s. In 1895 Japan took control of Taiwan and ruled it until the end of World War II in 1945. After the war, Taiwan was returned to China.

At that time, China was in the midst of a civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists. When the Communists won in 1949, the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek and his followers fled to Taiwan. There they established the Republic of China, claiming to be China's legitimate government.

For many years, the United States and other countries recognized Taiwan as China's legitimate government. However, in the 1970s, many countries, including the United States, switched their recognition to the People's Republic of China. Today, few countries officially recognize Taiwan as an independent country. However, many countries maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan.

The relationship between China and Taiwan remains tense. China considers Taiwan to be part of its territory and has threatened to use force if Taiwan declares independence. Taiwan, meanwhile, has a growing independence movement. Some Taiwanese want to formally declare independence from China, while others prefer to maintain the current situation.

### Land and Climate

Taiwan is a mountainous island. Mountains cover about two-thirds of the island, with the highest peaks reaching more than 13,000 feet (3,962 m). The mountains run down the center of the island from north to south. Most people live in the flatter areas along the western coast.

Taiwan has a subtropical climate, with hot, humid summers and mild winters. The island receives abundant rainfall, which supports lush vegetation. Taiwan is also prone to typhoons, which can cause flooding and landslides.

### People and Economy

Taiwan has a population of about 23 million people, making it one of the most densely populated places in the world. Most Taiwanese are ethnically Chinese, descendants of settlers from mainland China. The official language is Mandarin Chinese, though many people also speak Taiwanese, a Chinese dialect.

The two largest cities are Taipei (TY-PAY) and Kao-hsiung (KOW SHY-OOHNG). Taipei, the capital, is Taiwan's main financial center. Because it has grown so quickly, it faces serious overcrowding and environmental problems. Kao-hsiung is a center of heavy industry and Taiwan's main seaport.

Taiwan is one of Asia's richest and most industrialized countries. It is a leader in the production and export of computers and sports equipment. Taiwan's farmers grow many crops as well, such as sugarcane.

## Tensions between China and Taiwan

| China | Taiwan |
|-------|--------|
| Considers Taiwan to be part of China | Claims to be China's true government |
| Threatens force if Taiwan declares independence | Growing movement for independence from China |
| Officially recognized by the United States | Unofficially recognized by the United States |
| Member of the United Nations | Unable to regain membership in the United Nations |

## Summary
In this lesson you learned about two of China's smaller neighbors—Mongolia and Taiwan. Mongolia is a wild land with a nomadic people who prize horses. In contrast, Taiwan is a modern and industrialized island.

## Social Studies Skills

### Identify Point of View

#### Define the Skill
Geographers study issues that affect the world's people and places. To better understand such issues, geographers seek to understand point of view. The way people look at an issue is their point of view. Often, a point of view expresses a person's frame of reference—the elements of a person's background that shapes how he or she sees the world. Sometimes, a point of view may also express a bias, or a one-sided, slanted, or prejudiced view.

To identify point of view, use these tips:
- Consider frame of reference. Think about where the person lives, what the person does, and what his or her beliefs and attitudes are.
- Examine the evidence, such as facts and statistics, to see what point of view it supports.
- Look for signs of bias. The inclusion or avoidance of particular facts and loaded or emotional language, such as name-calling, can reveal both bias and point of view.
- Put it all together to identify the point of view.

#### Learn the Skill
Read the passage "New Law Angers Taiwan" about a law forbidding any part of China to declare independence. Then answer the questions that follow.

**New Law Angers Taiwan**

Taiwan's government has warned that China's new anti-secession [anti-independence] law will have a "serious impact" on security in the region. Taiwan officials were quick to call the measure a "war bill," coming as China boosts its military spending by 13 percent to $30 billion.

But Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said the new legislation [law] was not a "war bill" and warned outsiders not to get involved. "It is not targeted at the people of Taiwan, nor is it a war bill," Wen said at a news conference.
