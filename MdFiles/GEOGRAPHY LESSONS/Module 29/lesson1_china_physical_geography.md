## Physical Features

The region encompassing China, Mongolia, and Taiwan has some of the world's most diverse and dramatic physical features, ranging from the world's highest mountains to vast deserts and fertile plains.

### Mountains

Mountains cover much of China and Mongolia, creating natural barriers that have historically isolated communities and influenced settlement patterns.

**The Himalaya Mountains** form part of China's southwestern border. This mountain range includes Mount Everest, the world's highest peak at 29,032 feet (8,849 meters). The Himalayas were formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, a process that continues today, causing the mountains to grow slightly taller each year.

**The Tian Shan** is a major mountain range in Central Asia that extends into western China. These mountains have historically served as a barrier between China and Central Asia, though passes through the range were important routes on the ancient Silk Road.

**The Altai Mountains** stretch across the borders of Mongolia, China, Russia, and Kazakhstan. In Mongolia, these mountains contain the country's highest peak, Khüiten Peak, at 14,350 feet (4,374 meters).

**The Kunlun Mountains** run along the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau in western China. This range is considered sacred in Chinese mythology and is sometimes referred to as the "backbone of the Earth."

**Taiwan's Central Mountain Range** runs from north to south through the island, with several peaks exceeding 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). These mountains cover about two-thirds of Taiwan's land area, forcing most of the population to settle along the western coastal plain.

### Plateaus and Basins

The region contains several significant plateaus and basins:

**The Tibetan Plateau**, often called the "Roof of the World," is the world's highest and largest plateau, covering much of southwestern China. With an average elevation of over 14,800 feet (4,500 meters), this plateau has a harsh climate with thin air, intense sunlight, and extreme temperature variations. Despite these challenging conditions, Tibetan people have adapted to life at high altitudes, developing unique cultural traditions centered around Buddhism.

**The Mongolian Plateau** covers most of Mongolia and parts of northern China. This high, flat region has an average elevation of about 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) and is characterized by grasslands (steppes), mountains, and the Gobi Desert.

**The Tarim Basin** in western China is a large, arid depression surrounded by mountains. The basin contains the Taklamakan Desert, one of the world's largest and most inhospitable deserts. Despite its harsh conditions, the basin's edges were important stops on the ancient Silk Road.

**The Sichuan Basin** in central China is a fertile region surrounded by mountains. Its rich soils and mild climate make it one of China's most productive agricultural areas, often called the "Land of Abundance."

### Plains and Lowlands

Several important plains and lowland areas support dense populations and intensive agriculture:

**The North China Plain** is one of China's most important agricultural regions, covering much of northeastern China. This vast, flat area is formed by sediments deposited by the Huang He (Yellow River) and other rivers. Despite periodic flooding and droughts, the plain's fertile soils have supported Chinese civilization for thousands of years.

**The Northeast China Plain** (also called the Manchurian Plain) extends across northeastern China. This region has colder winters than the North China Plain but is still an important agricultural area, particularly for wheat, corn, and soybeans.

**The Middle and Lower Yangtze Plains** surround the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in central and eastern China. These humid, subtropical lowlands are major rice-producing regions.

**The Pearl River Delta** in southeastern China is a densely populated and highly industrialized region where the Pearl River flows into the South China Sea. The cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong are located in this area, making it one of China's most economically dynamic regions.

**Taiwan's Western Coastal Plain** is a narrow strip of lowland between Taiwan's central mountains and the Taiwan Strait. Though comprising only about one-third of Taiwan's land area, this plain is home to most of the island's population and agricultural production.

### Rivers

Rivers have played a crucial role in the development of Chinese civilization, providing water for irrigation, transportation routes, and fertile soil for agriculture.

**The Huang He (Yellow River)** is often called "China's Sorrow" because of its devastating floods throughout history. The river gets its name from the yellow-colored loess soil it carries from the Loess Plateau. The Huang He flows for about 3,395 miles (5,464 kilometers) from the Tibetan Plateau to the Bohai Sea, passing through the North China Plain.

The Huang He has changed its course many times throughout history, sometimes with catastrophic consequences. In 1887, a flood killed an estimated 900,000 to 2 million people, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. Today, the river is heavily engineered with dams and levees to control flooding and generate hydroelectric power.

**The Chang Jiang (Yangtze River)** is the longest river in Asia and the third-longest in the world, flowing for 3,915 miles (6,300 kilometers) from the Tibetan Plateau to the East China Sea. The Yangtze Basin is home to about one-third of China's population and is a major economic corridor.

The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze, completed in 2006, is the world's largest hydroelectric power station. While the dam provides renewable energy and flood control, its construction required the relocation of over 1.3 million people and has caused significant environmental changes.

**The Xi Jiang (Pearl River)** is southern China's largest river, flowing through one of the country's most economically developed regions. The river's delta is home to major cities including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong.

**The Mekong River** begins in the Tibetan Plateau and flows through China's Yunnan Province before continuing through Southeast Asia. Though less economically significant within China than the Huang He or Yangtze, the Mekong is an important international river that supports millions of people across multiple countries.

**Mongolia's rivers** are fewer and smaller than China's. The most significant is the Selenga River, which flows northward into Russia and eventually into Lake Baikal, the world's deepest lake. Mongolia also has numerous smaller rivers that are vital to local ecosystems and communities.

**Taiwan's rivers** are generally short and steep, flowing rapidly from the central mountains to the surrounding seas. These rivers provide water for irrigation and hydroelectric power but are prone to flooding during typhoons.

## Climate and Resources

### Climate Patterns

The climate of China, Mongolia, and Taiwan varies dramatically due to the region's vast size, diverse topography, and location relative to oceans and air masses.

**Eastern China** has a monsoon climate, with wet summers and dry winters. The summer monsoon brings warm, moist air from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in heavy rainfall, particularly in southeastern China. Winter monsoons bring cold, dry air from Siberia, causing cold, dry winters, especially in northern China.

**Southern China** has a subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and mild winters. This region rarely experiences freezing temperatures and receives abundant rainfall throughout the year, making it suitable for growing rice and other crops that require lots of water.

**Northern China** has a temperate climate with hot summers and cold winters. The North China Plain experiences distinct seasons, with temperatures ranging from below freezing in winter to over 86°F (30°C) in summer. Rainfall is concentrated in the summer months, with relatively dry conditions during the rest of the year.

**Western China** has an arid or semi-arid climate, with the Taklamakan and Gobi deserts receiving very little precipitation. The Tibetan Plateau has a harsh highland climate with intense solar radiation, low temperatures, and limited rainfall.

**Mongolia** has an extreme continental climate with long, very cold winters and short, warm summers. The country experiences large temperature variations, both seasonally and daily. January temperatures in Ulaanbaatar, the capital, average around -13°F (-25°C), while July temperatures average about 64°F (18°C). Precipitation is low throughout the country, with most areas receiving less than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain annually.

**Taiwan** has a subtropical climate in the north and a tropical climate in the south. The island receives abundant rainfall, particularly during the summer monsoon season. Taiwan is also affected by typhoons, powerful tropical cyclones that can cause severe flooding and wind damage, typically between July and October.

In the north and west, the climate is mainly dry. Temperatures vary across the area and can get both very hot and cold.

### Natural Resources

The region's natural resources are as diverse as its physical geography and climate:

**China** has a wealth of natural resources. Like its climate, China's natural resources show tremendous variety. The country is rich in mineral resources and is a leading producer of coal, lead, tin, and tungsten. China produces many other minerals and metals as well. China's forestland and farmland are also valuable resources.

China has the world's largest reserves of rare earth elements, which are crucial for many high-tech products and renewable energy technologies. However, mining these resources has caused significant environmental damage in some areas.

China's agricultural resources are substantial, though unevenly distributed. The fertile plains along major rivers support intensive agriculture, while mountainous and desert regions are less productive. Water is becoming an increasingly scarce resource in many parts of China, particularly in the north.

**Mongolia's** natural resources include minerals such as coal, iron, and tin as well as livestock. Mongolia has significant deposits of copper, gold, and coal, which have attracted foreign investment and driven economic growth in recent years. The country's vast grasslands support traditional nomadic herding of sheep, goats, cattle, horses, and camels.

**Taiwan's** major natural resource is its farmland. Important crops include sugarcane, tea, and bananas. Taiwan has limited mineral resources and is heavily dependent on imports for energy and raw materials. However, the island has developed a strong industrial economy based on manufacturing and technology, leveraging its well-educated workforce rather than natural resources.

## Summary

China, Mongolia, and Taiwan have a range of physical features, climate, and resources. The region encompasses some of the world's most diverse landscapes, from the towering Himalaya Mountains to the vast North China Plain, from the arid Gobi Desert to the lush subtropical regions of southern China and Taiwan. Major rivers, particularly the Huang He and Chang Jiang, have shaped Chinese civilization for millennia, providing water, transportation, and fertile soil but also causing devastating floods.

The climate varies dramatically across the region, from the harsh continental climate of Mongolia to the tropical conditions of southern Taiwan. These diverse environments have influenced settlement patterns, agricultural practices, and cultural development throughout the region's history.

Natural resources are unevenly distributed, with China possessing a wide variety of mineral and agricultural resources, Mongolia having significant mineral deposits and grasslands for herding, and Taiwan relying primarily on its limited agricultural land and human capital.

Understanding the physical geography of this region is essential for comprehending its historical development, current economic activities, and future challenges, particularly in the face of environmental pressures and climate change.
