## History

Many countries of Central America have a shared history. This shared history has been influenced by the Maya, the Spanish, and the United States.

### Early History

In several Central American countries, the Maya were building large cities with pyramids and temples by about AD 250. The Maya abandoned most of their cities around 900, but the ruins of many ancient cities still stand in the region today. People of Maya descent still live in Guatemala and Belize. In fact, many ancient Maya customs still influence modern life there.

Hundreds of years later, in the early 1500s, most of Central America came under European control. Spain claimed most of the region. Britain claimed what is now Belize and also occupied part of Nicaragua's coast. The Spanish established large plantations in their colonies to grow crops like tobacco and sugarcane. They made Central American Indians work on the plantations or in gold mines elsewhere in the Americas.

### Independence and Aftermath

In 1821, Central America gained independence from Spain. For a brief period, the region was part of the Mexican Empire. Then, from 1823 to 1838, most of Central America formed the United Provinces of Central America. This federation included what are now the countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. However, the federation broke apart due to conflicts between conservatives and liberals, as well as regional rivalries.

After the breakup of the federation, the five countries became independent nations. Belize remained a British colony until 1981. Panama was part of Colombia until 1903, when it became independent with U.S. support.

Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the countries of Central America experienced political instability, with frequent changes of government and periods of dictatorship. Many countries developed economies based on the export of a few agricultural products, particularly coffee and bananas. This made them vulnerable to fluctuations in world markets and led to the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a small elite.

### U.S. Influence

The United States has played a significant role in Central American history, particularly in the 20th century. U.S. companies, especially the United Fruit Company (now Chiquita), established large banana plantations in several Central American countries. These companies often wielded considerable political influence.

The U.S. government has intervened militarily in Central America on several occasions. For example, U.S. Marines occupied Nicaragua from 1912 to 1933. The U.S. also supported the overthrow of Guatemala's democratically elected government in 1954.

One of the most significant U.S. projects in the region was the construction of the Panama Canal. The canal, which opened in 1914, connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and is a vital shipping route. The U.S. controlled the Canal Zone until 1999, when it was transferred to Panama.

### Civil Wars and Recent History

In the latter half of the 20th century, several Central American countries experienced civil wars and political violence. These conflicts were often rooted in social inequality, political repression, and Cold War tensions.

- **Guatemala** experienced a 36-year civil war (1960-1996) between the government and leftist guerrilla groups. The conflict resulted in approximately 200,000 deaths, many of them indigenous Maya.

- **El Salvador** endured a civil war from 1980 to 1992 between the military-led government and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN). The war claimed about 75,000 lives.

- **Nicaragua** saw the Sandinista revolution overthrow the Somoza dictatorship in 1979, followed by a civil war between the Sandinista government and U.S.-backed Contra rebels in the 1980s.

Peace agreements were signed in all these countries by the mid-1990s, leading to democratic elections and attempts at reconciliation. However, the legacy of these conflicts continues to affect the region today.

## Culture

The culture of Central America is a rich blend of indigenous, European (primarily Spanish), and African influences. This cultural mix is evident in the region's languages, religions, arts, and daily life.

### Languages

Spanish is the official language of most Central American countries, reflecting the region's colonial history. However, many indigenous languages are also spoken, particularly in Guatemala, where about 40% of the population is of Maya descent. In Belize, English is the official language, although Spanish and Creole are widely spoken.

Some of the indigenous languages spoken in the region include:

- **K'iche'**, **Kaqchikel**, **Q'eqchi'**, and other Maya languages in Guatemala and Belize
- **Garifuna** along the Caribbean coast of Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua
- **Miskito** in Nicaragua and Honduras
- **Ngäbe** and **Buglé** in Panama

### Religion

Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion in Central America, introduced by Spanish colonizers. However, in recent decades, Protestant denominations, particularly Evangelical and Pentecostal churches, have gained many followers.

Indigenous religious practices also continue in some areas, often blended with Catholic traditions. This religious syncretism is particularly evident in highland Guatemala, where Maya spiritual practices are combined with Catholic rituals.

### Arts and Crafts

Central America has a rich tradition of arts and crafts, often combining indigenous techniques with European influences:

- **Textiles**: Guatemala is famous for its colorful woven textiles, produced using traditional backstrap looms. Each region has its own distinctive patterns and designs.

- **Pottery**: Traditional pottery is produced throughout the region, with notable centers in Nicaragua and Costa Rica.

- **Wood Carving**: Intricate wood carvings, including masks and religious figures, are created in many parts of Central America.

- **Music and Dance**: Traditional music often combines indigenous, European, and African elements. Each country has its own distinctive musical traditions, such as the marimba music of Guatemala and the punta of Belize.

### Food

Central American cuisine reflects the region's cultural diversity:

- **Corn (Maize)**: As in much of Latin America, corn is a staple food, used to make tortillas, tamales, and other dishes.

- **Beans**: Black beans and red beans are common throughout the region, often served with rice.

- **Plantains**: These starchy relatives of bananas are prepared in various ways, including fried as tostones or maduros.

- **Seafood**: Coastal areas have rich traditions of seafood dishes, including ceviche (raw fish marinated in citrus juice).

- **Tropical Fruits**: The region's warm climate supports a wide variety of fruits, including mangoes, papayas, and pineapples.

Each country has its own specialties, such as pupusas (stuffed corn tortillas) in El Salvador, gallo pinto (rice and beans) in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and baleadas (wheat flour tortillas filled with beans, cheese, and cream) in Honduras.

## Contemporary Central America

Today, the countries of Central America face a range of challenges and opportunities. While they share many common issues, each country has its own unique situation.

### Political Situation

The political landscape of Central America is diverse:

- **Costa Rica** has the longest democratic tradition in the region, with no standing army since 1949 and relatively stable political institutions.

- **Panama** has developed a stable democracy since the end of Manuel Noriega's dictatorship in 1989 and the transfer of the Panama Canal from U.S. to Panamanian control in 1999.

- **Guatemala**, **El Salvador**, and **Honduras** continue to struggle with political instability, corruption, and the legacy of civil wars. These countries, known as the Northern Triangle, face particularly severe challenges related to gang violence and organized crime.

- **Nicaragua** has experienced democratic backsliding under President Daniel Ortega, who has consolidated power and suppressed opposition.

- **Belize**, the smallest and newest independent country in the region, has maintained a parliamentary democracy since independence in 1981.

### Economic Challenges and Opportunities

The economies of Central America face several challenges:

- **Poverty and Inequality**: Despite economic growth in recent decades, poverty remains widespread in much of Central America. Income inequality is among the highest in the world, with a small elite controlling much of the wealth.

- **Dependence on Agriculture**: Many Central American economies still rely heavily on agricultural exports, making them vulnerable to price fluctuations and natural disasters.

- **Limited Industrial Development**: Manufacturing and high-value services are limited in most Central American countries, although there has been growth in sectors like textiles and call centers.

- **Remittances**: Money sent home by migrants working abroad, particularly in the United States, is a major source of income for several Central American countries, especially El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

Despite these challenges, there are also economic opportunities:

- **Tourism**: The region's natural beauty, archaeological sites, and cultural attractions draw millions of tourists each year. Costa Rica, in particular, has developed a successful ecotourism industry.

- **Regional Integration**: The Central American Integration System (SICA) and the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) with the United States aim to promote regional cooperation and trade.

- **Panama Canal**: The expansion of the Panama Canal, completed in 2016, has increased its capacity and importance as a global shipping route.

### Social Issues

Central America faces several pressing social issues:

- **Violence and Crime**: Gang violence, drug trafficking, and high homicide rates affect several countries, particularly in the Northern Triangle. El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala have some of the highest murder rates in the world.

- **Migration**: Economic hardship, violence, and natural disasters have driven many Central Americans to migrate, primarily to the United States. This migration has created both challenges and opportunities, including the significant role of remittances in the region's economies.

- **Education and Healthcare**: Access to quality education and healthcare remains limited in many parts of Central America, particularly in rural areas and among indigenous populations.

- **Environmental Challenges**: Deforestation, water pollution, and vulnerability to natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes pose significant challenges to sustainable development.
