## If YOU lived there...
You and your family live in Toronto, Ontario. Your parents, who are architects, have been offered an important project in Montreal. If they accept it, you would live there for two years. Montreal is a major city in French-speaking Quebec. You would have to learn a new language. In Montreal, most street signs and advertisements are written in French.

**How do you feel about moving to a city with a different language and culture?**

## Canada's Government

"Peace, order, and good government" is a statement from Canada's constitution that Canadians greatly value. The country's 1867 founding document provided the framework for Canada's current government. It has been amended and modified a number of times since then, but the constitution has maintained its basic structure. It still holds the force of the highest law in the land.

### Constitutional Monarchy

In part for historical reasons, Canada's government can be characterized as a constitutional monarchy. The monarch in the United Kingdom inherits the right to rule. Laws strictly limit the monarch's role in government. On the other hand, the royal influence can be seen in the often ceremonial duties of the governor general, who represents the monarch in Canada.

Canada is also a parliamentary democracy. The prime minister is the head of government and is usually the leader of the political party that has the most seats in the House of Commons. The prime minister and the cabinet ministers make up the executive branch of government.

### Parliament

Canada's parliament consists of two houses: the House of Commons and the Senate. Members of the House of Commons are elected by the people. The Senate is made up of members who are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister. The Senate is less powerful than the House of Commons.

The parliament makes laws for the entire country. However, the provinces have their own legislatures that make laws on matters within their jurisdiction, such as education and healthcare.

### Federal System

Canada has a federal system of government, similar to that of the United States. Power is divided between the national (federal) government and the provincial governments. The federal government handles matters such as national defense, foreign policy, and trade. Provincial governments are responsible for education, healthcare, and other local matters.

Canada has ten provinces and three territories. The territories have less autonomy than the provinces and are more directly controlled by the federal government.

## Regions of Canada

Canada is a vast country with distinct regions that differ in geography, climate, resources, and culture. **Regionalism**, or strong identification with a particular region, is a significant feature of Canadian society.

### The Eastern Provinces

The Eastern Provinces include the **maritime** provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, as well as Newfoundland and Labrador. These provinces have a strong connection to the sea. Fishing has traditionally been an important industry, although it has declined in recent decades due to overfishing.

The Eastern Provinces also include Quebec and Ontario, which are the most populous provinces in Canada. Quebec is predominantly French-speaking and has a distinct culture. **Montreal** is the largest city in Quebec and the second-largest city in Canada. It is a center of French-Canadian culture, with a rich history and vibrant arts scene.

Ontario is the most populous province and the economic center of Canada. Toronto, the largest city in Canada, is located in Ontario. **Ottawa**, the capital of Canada, is also in Ontario, on the border with Quebec.

### The Western Provinces

The Western Provinces include Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia. These provinces are known for their natural resources, including fertile farmland, forests, and minerals.

Manitoba and Saskatchewan are part of the Canadian prairies, a vast area of flat, fertile land that is ideal for agriculture. These provinces produce much of Canada's wheat and other grains.

Alberta is rich in oil and natural gas. The province has experienced economic booms and busts tied to the price of oil. Calgary, a major city in Alberta, is a center for the oil and gas industry.

British Columbia, on the Pacific coast, has a diverse economy that includes forestry, mining, fishing, and tourism. **Vancouver**, the largest city in British Columbia, is a major port and a gateway to Asia. It is known for its beautiful setting between the mountains and the sea.

### The Canadian North

The Canadian North includes the territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. This region is sparsely populated and has a harsh climate. Much of the land is tundra, where the ground is permanently frozen below the surface.

The Canadian North is rich in natural resources, including minerals and oil. However, the harsh climate and remote location make resource extraction challenging and expensive.

Indigenous peoples make up a significant portion of the population in the Canadian North. The territory of Nunavut, created in 1999, is governed primarily by the Inuit people.

### Quebec and Regionalism

Quebec's distinct French-speaking culture has led to tensions with the rest of Canada, which is predominantly English-speaking. Some Quebecois (residents of Quebec) have advocated for independence from Canada.

In 1980 and 1995, Quebec held referendums on whether to separate from Canada. Both times, the majority voted to remain part of Canada, but the 1995 vote was very close. Since then, the separatist movement has weakened, but Quebec's distinct identity remains strong.

The Canadian government has made efforts to accommodate Quebec's cultural distinctiveness. French and English are both official languages of Canada, and the federal government provides services in both languages.

## Canada's Economy

Canada has a developed, diversified economy that is closely tied to that of the United States. The country is rich in natural resources, which play a significant role in its economy.

### Natural Resources

Canada's vast forests provide timber and pulp for paper production. The country is a major exporter of forest products.

The Canadian Shield contains valuable minerals, including nickel, zinc, copper, and gold. Canada is also a major producer of uranium, which is used in nuclear power plants.

Alberta's oil sands contain one of the largest oil reserves in the world. However, extracting oil from the sands is more expensive and environmentally damaging than conventional oil production.

The fertile plains of the Western Provinces produce large amounts of wheat and other grains. Canada is one of the world's leading exporters of agricultural products.

### Trade with the United States

The United States is Canada's largest trading partner. The two countries have the world's largest bilateral trading relationship, with hundreds of billions of dollars in goods and services crossing the border each year.

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which came into effect in 1994, eliminated most tariffs on trade between Canada, the United States, and Mexico. This has led to increased trade and economic integration among the three countries.

Canada exports natural resources, manufactured goods, and services to the United States. In return, it imports a wide range of products, including machinery, vehicles, and consumer goods.

### Tourism

Tourism is an important part of Canada's economy. The country's natural beauty, diverse cities, and cultural attractions draw millions of visitors each year.

Popular tourist destinations include the Rocky Mountains in Alberta and British Columbia, Niagara Falls in Ontario, and the historic cities of Quebec and Montreal. Canada's national parks, such as Banff and Jasper in Alberta, attract visitors who enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, skiing, and wildlife viewing.

In recent years, Canada has faced challenges in attracting tourists from the United States. Between 2010 and 2015, the number of American visitors to Canada declined, partly due to stricter border security measures and the stronger Canadian dollar. In response, Canada launched a marketing campaign called "Connecting America" to encourage more Americans to visit Canada.

### Challenges and Opportunities

Canada's economy faces several challenges. The country's dependence on natural resource exports makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. For example, when oil prices fall, Alberta's economy suffers.

Climate change poses challenges for Canada, particularly in the North, where rising temperatures are causing permafrost to thaw and affecting traditional ways of life.

However, Canada also has opportunities for economic growth. The country's highly educated workforce and strong research institutions position it well for the knowledge economy. Canada's cultural diversity and connections to countries around the world can help it expand its trade relationships beyond the United States.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned that Canada has distinct regions that are separated by both geography and culture. The country has a democratic government with a prime minister and a parliament. Canada's economy is largely based on natural resources and trade with the United States. The United States and Canada share a common history, a border, and the English language.
