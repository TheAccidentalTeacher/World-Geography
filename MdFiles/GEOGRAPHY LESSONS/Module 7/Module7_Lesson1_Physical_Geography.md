- Because of its northerly location, Canada is dominated by cold climates.
- Canada is rich in natural resources like fish, minerals, forests, and farmland.

## Key Terms and Places
- Rocky Mountains
- St. Lawrence River
- Niagara Falls
- Canadian Shield
- Grand Banks
- pulp
- newsprint

## If YOU lived there...
You live in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in central Canada. Your hiking club is trying to decide where to go on a trip this summer. Since you live on the plains, some people want to visit the rugged Rocky Mountains in the west. Others want to travel north to Hudson Bay to see polar bears and other wildlife. Others would rather hike in the east near the Great Lakes and Niagara Falls.

## Physical Features

Did you know that Canada is the second-largest country in the world? Russia is the only country in the world that is larger than Canada. The United States is the third-largest country in the world. Canada is slightly larger than the United States, even though it has a much smaller population.

Look at the physical map of Canada. See if you can find the physical features that the United States and Canada share. You may notice that mountains along the Pacific coast and the **Rocky Mountains** extend north into western Canada from the western United States. Broad plains stretch across the interiors of both countries. In the east, the two countries share a natural border formed by the **St. Lawrence River**. An important international waterway, the St. Lawrence River connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean.

### Western Mountains and Plains

The western part of Canada has several mountain ranges. The Rocky Mountains, which begin in the United States, extend north through western Canada. The Coast Mountains run along the Pacific coast. Between these mountain ranges lies a plateau, or area of high flat land.

The interior plains of Canada stretch from the Rocky Mountains east to the Great Lakes. These plains are similar to the Great Plains of the United States. They are mostly flat and covered with grasses. The plains are excellent for farming and raising livestock.

### Eastern Forests and Waterways

Eastern Canada has several important physical features. The Great Lakes, which Canada shares with the United States, are the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world. The St. Lawrence River flows from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean.

**Niagara Falls** is located on the Niagara River, which connects Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The falls are among the largest and most powerful in the world. They are a major tourist attraction and a source of hydroelectric power.

The **Canadian Shield** is a large region of ancient rock that covers much of eastern and central Canada. It is shaped like a horseshoe around Hudson Bay. The Canadian Shield has thin soil and many lakes and swamps. It is not good for farming, but it is rich in minerals.

### Northern Territories

Northern Canada is a vast wilderness with few people. Much of this region is covered by tundra, a treeless plain where the ground is permanently frozen below the surface. The Arctic Archipelago, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, is part of northern Canada.

## Climate

Canada's climate is strongly influenced by its northerly location. Most of the country has cold winters and cool to warm summers. However, there are regional variations in climate.

### Regional Climate Variations

The western coast of Canada has a mild, rainy climate similar to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The Rocky Mountains block moist air from the Pacific, creating a rain shadow effect. This makes the interior plains drier than the coast.

The interior plains have a continental climate with cold winters and warm summers. The eastern part of Canada has a humid continental climate with cold winters and warm, humid summers.

Northern Canada has a polar climate with extremely cold winters and cool summers. In the far north, temperatures can remain below freezing for much of the year.

### Effects of Climate on Life

Canada's climate affects how people live. In the cold northern regions, people have adapted to the harsh conditions. Traditional Inuit (native people of the Arctic) built homes from snow and ice. Today, modern buildings in the north are designed to withstand the cold.

The short growing season in much of Canada limits agriculture. However, the interior plains have a long enough growing season to support wheat and other crops. The mild climate of the west coast allows for a greater variety of agriculture.

Canada's cold climate also affects transportation. Many northern communities can only be reached by air or by ice roads in winter. The St. Lawrence Seaway, a system of locks, canals, and channels, allows ships to travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes, but it is closed during winter when the water freezes.

## Natural Resources

Canada is rich in natural resources, which are important to its economy. These resources include fish, minerals, forests, and farmland.

### Fishing

Fishing has been important to Canada's economy for centuries. The **Grand Banks** is an area of shallow water off the east coast of Canada where the cold Labrador Current meets the warm Gulf Stream. This mixing of waters creates ideal conditions for plankton, which attracts fish. The Grand Banks is one of the richest fishing grounds in the world.

However, overfishing has become a problem in recent decades. Some fish populations, such as cod, have declined dramatically. The Canadian government has imposed restrictions on fishing to help fish populations recover.

### Agriculture

Despite its cold climate, Canada has significant agricultural resources. The interior plains, particularly the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, are known as Canada's "breadbasket." These provinces produce large amounts of wheat and other grains.

Southern Ontario and Quebec have fertile soil and a long enough growing season to support a variety of crops, including fruits and vegetables. The mild climate of the west coast, particularly in British Columbia, allows for the cultivation of fruits and vegetables as well.

### Minerals and Forests

The Canadian Shield contains many valuable minerals. Canada is a leading producer of nickel, zinc, and uranium. Other important minerals include lead, copper, gold, and silver. The province of Saskatchewan has large deposits of potash, which is used to make fertilizer. Alberta is rich in oil and natural gas.

Canada's vast forests are another important resource. The forests stretch across most of the country from Labrador to the Pacific coast. These trees provide lumber and **pulp**. Pulp—softened wood fibers—is used to make paper. Canada is a major producer of **newsprint**, which is cheap paper used mainly for newspapers. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan get much of their newsprint from Canada.

### Environmental Concerns

Canada's natural resources have brought wealth to the country, but their exploitation has also raised environmental concerns. Acid rain, caused by industrial pollution, has damaged forests and lakes in eastern Canada. In response, Canada has passed laws to limit pollution and has established programs to monitor air quality.

Deforestation is another concern. While Canada has sustainable forestry practices, the loss of old-growth forests can harm biodiversity. Climate change is affecting Canada's Arctic regions, where rising temperatures are causing permafrost to thaw and sea ice to melt.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned that Canada shares many physical features with the United States. However, Canada's geography is also different. Due to its northerly location, Canada has a cold climate. Fish, minerals, fertile soil, and forests are all important natural resources.

## Assessment

### Review Ideas, Terms, and Places

1. a. Recall: What river links the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean?
   b. Explain: What physical features does Niagara Falls flow between?
   c. Geographic Questions: Look at the map in this lesson. Pose and answer a question about Canada's physical geography.

2. a. Describe: How is Canada's climate related to its northerly location?
   b. Draw Conclusions: Locate Canada on the map in this lesson. Where would you expect to find Canada's coldest climate? Why?

3. a. Define: What is the Grand Banks?
   b. Interpret: How are Canada's forests a valuable resource?

### Critical Thinking

4. Generalize: Using your notes on Canada's resources, identify the location of each type of resource.
