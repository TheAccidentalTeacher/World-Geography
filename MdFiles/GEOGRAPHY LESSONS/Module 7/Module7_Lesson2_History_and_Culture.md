## If YOU lived there...
You own a general store in Calgary, Alberta, in the early 1880s. Your town is a center for agriculture and ranching on the prairies around you. Still, it sometimes feels very isolated. You miss your family in Ontario. Now the news comes that the Canadian Pacific Railway will soon reach Calgary. It will connect the town with all of central and eastern Canada.

**How will the railroad change your life?**

## History

As the ice sheets of the ice ages melted, people moved into all areas of what is now Canada. As they did elsewhere in the Americas, these ancient settlers adapted to the physical environment.

### Native Canadians

Native peoples such as the Inuit (ih-nu-wuht) peoples and others were the first Canadians. Over the years, some of these native peoples divided into groups that became known as the First Nations. One group living on Canada's vast interior plains, the Cree, were skilled bison hunters. In the far north, the Inuits adapted to the region's extreme cold, where farming was impossible. By hunting seals, whales, walruses, and other animals, the Inuits could feed, clothe, and shelter themselves.

### European Settlement

In the 1500s, Europeans began to explore the region that would later become Canada. The French explorer Jacques Cartier sailed up the St. Lawrence River in 1535. In the early 1600s, the French established settlements along the St. Lawrence River. The most important of these was **Quebec**, founded in 1608. The French settlers, known as habitants, farmed the land along the river.

The British also established settlements in what is now Canada. In the late 1700s, Britain and France fought for control of North America. Britain won the conflict, and France gave up its North American territories in 1763. However, the French settlers were allowed to keep their language, religion, and customs.

### Confederation

In 1867, several British colonies in North America united to form the Dominion of Canada. These colonies became **provinces**, or political regions similar to states in the United States. The original provinces were Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Over time, more provinces joined the confederation.

In 1871, **British Columbia**, on the Pacific coast, joined the confederation. The Canadian government promised to build a railroad connecting British Columbia with the eastern provinces. The Canadian Pacific Railway was completed in 1885. It played a crucial role in uniting the country and opening the western regions to settlement.

### Twentieth Century

In the 20th century, Canada became increasingly independent from Britain. During World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945), Canadian troops fought alongside British forces. These wars helped strengthen Canada's national identity.

After World War II, Canada experienced economic growth and social change. The country developed a strong social welfare system, including universal healthcare. In 1982, Canada adopted its own constitution, further reducing its ties to Britain.

## Culture

Canada's culture has been shaped by its native peoples, European settlers, and immigrants from around the world. The country has two official languages, English and French, reflecting its colonial history.

### Immigration

Immigration has played a significant role in shaping Canadian culture. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many immigrants came from Europe, particularly from Britain, Ireland, and Eastern Europe. These immigrants helped settle the western provinces and build the Canadian Pacific Railway.

Chinese immigrants also came to Canada in the 19th century, many to work on the railroad. Despite facing discrimination, they established communities in cities like Vancouver, where Chinatown became a vibrant cultural center.

In recent decades, Canada has welcomed immigrants from all over the world. Many have come from Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America. These newcomers have enriched Canadian culture with their languages, traditions, and cuisines.

### Urban Migration

Many Canadians have moved from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities. **Toronto**, in Ontario, is Canada's largest city and a major financial center. It is known for its diverse population and cultural attractions.

Vancouver, in British Columbia, has grown rapidly due to its mild climate, beautiful setting, and economic opportunities. It has become a major port and a gateway to Asia. Montreal, in Quebec, is the center of French-Canadian culture and a hub for arts and education.

The movement to cities has led to the decline of some rural communities. However, it has also created vibrant urban centers where different cultures mix and interact.

### Cultural Diversity

Canada celebrates its cultural diversity. The government has adopted a policy of multiculturalism, which recognizes and promotes the value of different cultural traditions. This policy encourages immigrants to maintain their cultural heritage while becoming part of Canadian society.

French-Canadian culture is particularly strong in Quebec, where most people speak French as their first language. Quebec has its own distinct literature, music, and cuisine. The province has sometimes sought greater autonomy or even independence from the rest of Canada.

Indigenous cultures have experienced a revival in recent decades. Many First Nations, Inuit, and MÃ©tis (people of mixed European and indigenous ancestry) are working to preserve their languages, traditions, and art forms. The Canadian government has made efforts to address historical injustices against indigenous peoples.

### Vancouver's Chinatown

Vancouver's Chinatown is one of the largest and oldest in North America. It began in the late 19th century when Chinese workers came to build the Canadian Pacific Railway. Despite facing discrimination and restrictions, the Chinese community established businesses and cultural institutions in this neighborhood.

Today, Vancouver's Chinatown is a vibrant cultural center. It features Chinese restaurants, shops selling silk clothing, herbs, and art imported from China, and traditional architecture. During the Chinese New Year, the neighborhood hosts a parade with people in traditional Chinese dress. Vancouver's Chinatown is a unique place where Chinese culture is kept alive in Canada today.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned that Canada was greatly influenced by British and French settlement, the building of the railroad to the Pacific coast, immigration, and movement to cities. Native peoples were the first inhabitants of what is now Canada. European settlement began in the 1600s, with the French establishing colonies along the St. Lawrence River. In 1867, several British colonies united to form the Dominion of Canada. The completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885 helped unite the country and open the western regions to settlement. Immigration and migration to cities have shaped Canadian culture, creating a diverse society with two official languages and a policy of multiculturalism.
