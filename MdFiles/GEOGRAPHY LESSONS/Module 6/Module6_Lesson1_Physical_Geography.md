# Lesson 1: Physical Geography

## The Big Idea
The United States is a large country with diverse physical features, climates, and resources.

## Main Ideas
- Major physical features of the United States include mountains, rivers, and plains.
- The climate of the United States is wetter in the East and South and drier in the West.
- The United States is rich in natural resources such as farmland, oil, forests, and minerals.

## Key Terms and Places
- Appalachian Mountains
- Great Lakes
- Mississippi River
- tributary
- Rocky Mountains
- continental divide

## If YOU lived there...
You live in St. Louis, Missouri, which is located on the Mississippi River. For the next few days, you will travel down the river on an old-fashioned steamboat. The Mississippi begins in Minnesota and flows south through ten states in the heart of the United States. On your trip, you bring a video camera to film life along this great river.

**What will you show in your video about the Mississippi?**

## Physical Features

The United States is the third-largest country in the world, behind Russia and Canada. Our country is home to an incredible variety of physical features. All but 2 of the 50 states—Alaska and Hawaii—make up the main part of the country.

Look at the physical map of the United States. It shows the main physical features of our country. Use the map as you read about America's physical geography in the East and South, the Interior Plains, and the West.

### The East and South

If you were traveling across the United States, you might start on the country's eastern coast. This low area, which is flat and close to sea level, is called the Atlantic Coastal Plain. As you go west, the land gradually rises higher.

Soon you reach the Appalachian Mountains. These mountains are among the oldest in the world. They are not very high, and they have rounded tops. The Appalachians stretch from Maine in the Northeast to Alabama in the South.

The Atlantic Coastal Plain continues south to Florida. The Gulf Coastal Plain extends west from Florida to Texas along the Gulf of Mexico. Like the Atlantic Coastal Plain, the Gulf Coastal Plain is low and flat.

### The Interior Plains

As you travel west from the Appalachians, you come across the vast Interior Plains that stretch to the Great Plains just east of the Rocky Mountains. The Interior Plains are filled with hills, lakes, and rivers. The first major water feature that you see here is called the Great Lakes. These lakes make up the largest group of freshwater lakes in the world. The Great Lakes are also an important waterway for trade between the United States and Canada.

West of the Great Lakes lies North America's largest and most important river, the Mississippi River. Tributaries in the Interior Plains flow to the Mississippi. A **tributary** is a smaller stream or river that flows into a larger stream or river.

Along the way, these rivers deposit rich silt. The silt creates fertile farmlands that cover most of the Interior Plains. The Missouri and Ohio rivers are huge tributaries of the Mississippi. They help drain the entire Interior Plains.

Look at the physical map of the United States. Notice that the land begins to increase in elevation west of the Interior Plains. This higher region is called the Great Plains. Vast areas of grasslands cover these plains. There are fewer rivers and not very many trees.

### The West

In the region called the West, several of the country's most rugged mountain ranges make up the Rocky Mountains. These enormous mountains, also called the Rockies, stretch as far as you can see. Many of the peaks are more than 14,000 feet (4,267 m) high.

The Rocky Mountains form a continental divide. A **continental divide** is a mountain ridge that determines the direction in which rivers flow. Rivers that begin on the eastern side of the Rockies flow toward the Atlantic Ocean. Rivers that begin on the western side flow toward the Pacific Ocean.

West of the Rockies, the land drops into a huge area called the Great Basin. This area includes the Mojave Desert. Farther west, the land rises again into the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges. These mountains run close to the Pacific coast. Between these mountains and the Pacific Ocean lies a narrow coastal plain.

## Climate

The United States has many different climates. A climate is the average weather pattern in a place over a long period of time. The climate of a place includes its average temperature and precipitation.

The climate of the United States is generally wetter in the East and South and drier in the West. The Northeast has cold winters and warm summers. The South has mild winters and hot summers. The West has varied climates, from the dry deserts of the Southwest to the rainy Pacific Northwest.

### Eastern and Southern Climates

The eastern and southern parts of the United States have a humid climate. This means that there is a lot of moisture in the air. The Northeast has a humid continental climate with cold winters and warm summers. The Southeast has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters and hot, humid summers.

### Western Climates

The western part of the United States has several different climates. The Great Plains have a semiarid climate, which means they get less rainfall than the East. The Rocky Mountain region has an alpine climate with cold winters and cool summers. The Southwest has a desert climate with hot, dry summers and mild winters. The Pacific coast has a Mediterranean climate with mild, rainy winters and warm, dry summers.

## Natural Resources

The United States is rich in natural resources. These resources have helped the country become one of the world's leading economic powers.

### Mineral Resources

The United States has many valuable mineral resources. Coal is found in the Appalachian Mountains and in several western states. It is used to generate electricity and to make steel. Oil and natural gas are found in Texas, Alaska, and other states. These fuels are used for transportation, heating, and electricity generation.

The country also has deposits of iron ore, copper, gold, silver, and many other minerals. These minerals are used to make a wide variety of products, from cars and buildings to electronics and jewelry.

### Water Resources

The United States has abundant water resources. The Great Lakes contain about 20 percent of the world's fresh surface water. The Mississippi River system drains about 40 percent of the continental United States. These water resources are used for drinking water, irrigation, transportation, and recreation.

### Land Resources

Other important resources include forests and farmland, which cover much of the country. The trees in our forests provide timber that is used in constructing buildings. Wood from these trees is also used to make paper.

Farmland produces a variety of crops including wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, fruits, and vegetables.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the geography, climates, and natural resources of the United States. The United States has diverse physical features including mountains, plains, and rivers. The climate varies from humid in the East and South to drier in the West. The country is rich in natural resources such as minerals, water, forests, and farmland.

## Assessment

### Review Ideas, Terms, and Places

1. a. Describe: What is a tributary?
   b. Contrast: How are the Appalachian Mountains different from the Rocky Mountains?
   c. Elaborate: Look at the U.S. physical map in this lesson to locate the Great Lakes. Why are the Great Lakes an important waterway?

2. a. Describe: Look at the U.S. climate map in this lesson. What is the climate like in the Northeast?
   b. Draw Conclusions: What would winter be like in Alaska?

3. a. Recall: What kinds of crops are grown in the United States?
   b. Explain: Why is coal an important nonrenewable natural resource? Where is it mined?
