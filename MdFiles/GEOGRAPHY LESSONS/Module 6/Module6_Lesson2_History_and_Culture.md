## If YOU lived there...
It is 1803, and President Jefferson just arranged the purchase of a huge area of land west of the Mississippi River. It almost doubles the size of the United States. Living on the frontier in Ohio, you are a skillful hunter and trapper. One day, you see a poster calling for volunteers to explore the new Louisiana Territory. An expedition is heading west soon. You think it would be exciting but dangerous.

**Will you join the expedition to the West? Why or why not?**

## First Modern Democracy

Long before Italian explorer Christopher Columbus sailed to the Americas in 1492, native people lived on the land that is now the United States. These Native Americans developed many distinct cultures. Soon after Columbus and his crew explored the Americas, other Europeans began to set up colonies there.

### The American Colonies

Europeans began settling in North America and setting up colonies in the 1500s. A **colony** is a territory inhabited and controlled by people from a foreign land. By 1733, the British had 13 colonies along the Atlantic coast.

The colonists built towns and cities. **Boston** and **New York** were two important colonial cities. In the South, colonists set up large farms called **plantations**. The colonists grew crops such as tobacco and cotton on these plantations.

### The American Revolution

By the 1770s, many colonists were unhappy with British rule. They wanted to govern themselves. In 1776, the colonists declared their independence from Britain. This led to the American Revolution, a war between the colonists and Britain.

The colonists won the war and gained their independence. In 1789, they established a new government based on the U.S. Constitution. The United States became the world's first modern democracy, a country in which citizens elect their leaders.

### Westward Expansion

After gaining independence, the United States began to expand westward. In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson purchased the Louisiana Territory from France. This doubled the size of the United States.

Many Americans moved west to settle the new lands. These settlers, called **pioneers**, traveled in covered wagons across the Great Plains. They built farms and towns as they went.

By the mid-1800s, the United States stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. This expansion led to conflicts with Native Americans, who were forced to give up their lands.

### Civil War and Reconstruction

In the 1800s, the United States faced a major crisis over slavery. The northern states wanted to end slavery, but the southern states wanted to keep it. This disagreement led to the Civil War (1861-1865).

The North won the war, and slavery was abolished. After the war, the country went through a period called Reconstruction, during which the South was rebuilt and former slaves gained citizenship rights.

### Becoming a World Power

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the United States became an industrial power. Factories produced goods that were sold around the world. Millions of immigrants came to the United States to work in these factories and start new lives.

The United States fought in World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945). After World War II, the United States became one of the world's most powerful countries.

## Government

The United States has a democratic government based on the **U.S. Constitution**. The Constitution divides the federal government into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial.

### Three Branches of Government

The **legislative branch** makes the laws. It consists of Congress, which has two parts: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Members of Congress are elected by the people.

The **executive branch** carries out the laws. It is headed by the President, who is elected every four years. The President is the head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

The **judicial branch** interprets the laws. It consists of the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Judges are appointed by the President and approved by the Senate.

### Levels of Government

The United States has a **federal system** of government. This means that power is divided between the national (federal) government and the state governments.

The federal government handles matters that affect the entire country, such as national defense, foreign policy, and interstate commerce. State governments handle matters within their borders, such as education, transportation, and public safety.

Below the state level, there are local governments, including counties, cities, and towns. These governments provide services such as police and fire protection, garbage collection, and local schools.

### Rights and Responsibilities of Citizens

American citizens have many rights, including freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to vote. They also have responsibilities, such as obeying the laws, paying taxes, and serving on juries.

One of the most important rights and responsibilities of citizens is voting. By voting, citizens choose their leaders and have a say in how they are governed.

## People and Culture

The United States is a nation of immigrants. Throughout its history, people from around the world have come to the United States seeking freedom and opportunity.

### Immigration

**Immigration** is the movement of people from one country to another. The United States has experienced several waves of immigration throughout its history.

In the 1800s and early 1900s, millions of Europeans came to the United States. They came from countries such as Ireland, Italy, Germany, and Russia. Many were fleeing poverty, persecution, or war.

In recent decades, many immigrants have come from Latin America, Asia, and Africa. They come for various reasons, including economic opportunity, political freedom, and family reunification.

### Cultural Diversity

The United States is known for its **cultural diversity**. This means that people from many different backgrounds live together in one country. This diversity is reflected in American food, music, language, and religion.

Many Americans speak languages other than English at home. Spanish is the second most commonly spoken language in the United States. Other languages spoken include Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Arabic, and many others.

Americans practice many different religions. Christianity is the most common religion, but there are also many Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and people of other faiths. Many Americans do not practice any religion.

### American Culture

American culture is a blend of influences from around the world. In addition to language and religion, cultural practices include the food we eat and the music we listen to.

America's food is as diverse as the American people. You may have eaten Mexican tacos, Italian pasta, or Japanese sushi. These dishes are now part of the American diet.

Different types of music from around the world have also influenced American culture. For example, salsa music from Latin America is popular in the United States today. African rhythms and instruments have also influenced American music. However, music that originated in the United States is also popular in other countries. American musical styles include blues, jazz, rock, and hip hop.

### American Popular Culture

As the most powerful country in the world, the United States has tremendous influence around the world. American popular culture, such as movies, television programs, and sports, is popular elsewhere.

American movies are seen by millions of people around the world. Other examples of American culture in other places include the popularity of baseball in Japan, American fast food restaurants in almost every major city in the world, and American television programs and channels broadcasting around the world. Americans influence the rest of the world in many ways through their culture.

## Summary

The history of the United States has helped shape the diverse, democratic nation it is today. The United States began as 13 British colonies along the Atlantic coast. After gaining independence, it expanded westward to the Pacific Ocean. The country's democratic government is based on the U.S. Constitution, which divides power between the federal, state, and local levels. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and its culture reflects influences from around the world.
