## If YOU lived there...
You and your family run a small resort hotel in Fort Lauderdale, on the east coast of Florida. You love the sunny weather and the beaches there. Now your family is thinking about moving the business to another region where the tourist industry is important. They have looked at ski lodges in Colorado, lake cottages in Michigan, and hotels on the coast of Maine.

**How will you decide among these different regions?**

## Regions of the United States

Because the United States is such a large country, geographers often divide it into four main geographic and economic regions. These are the Northeast, the South, the Midwest, and the West. You can see the four regions on the map Regions of the United States. Find the region where you live. You probably know more about your own region than you do the other three. The population, resources, and economies of the four regions are similar in some ways and unique in others.

### The Northeast

The Northeast shares a border with Canada. It includes the New England states and the Middle Atlantic states. The Northeast is the smallest of the four regions, but it is the most densely populated. This means that it has more people per square mile than any other region.

The Northeast is home to many large cities. These cities form a megalopolis, or a chain of connected urban areas, that stretches from Boston to Washington, D.C. **Washington, DC**, is the capital of the United States and the center of the federal government.

The Northeast was the first region to industrialize. Today, it is a center of finance, education, and technology. Many major banks, universities, and high-tech companies are located in the Northeast.

### The South

The South includes states that stretch from the Atlantic Ocean to Texas. This region has a warm climate and a long growing season. Historically, agriculture was the main economic activity in the South. Cotton, tobacco, and rice were important crops.

Today, the South has a diverse economy. Manufacturing, tourism, and service industries are important. Many people have moved to the South in recent decades because of job opportunities and the warm climate.

The South has a rich cultural heritage. It is known for its music, food, and literature. The region has a large African American population, whose culture has greatly influenced American music and art.

### The Midwest

The Midwest is often called the nation's heartland. It includes states in the central part of the country. The Midwest has fertile soil and a favorable climate for growing crops. It is a major agricultural region, producing corn, soybeans, wheat, and other crops.

The Midwest is also an important manufacturing region. **Detroit** is known for its automobile industry, and **Chicago** is a major transportation and industrial center. The Great Lakes provide a waterway for shipping goods.

The Midwest has experienced economic challenges in recent decades. Some manufacturing jobs have been lost to automation and overseas competition. However, the region remains an important part of the U.S. economy.

### The West

The West is the largest and most geographically diverse of the four regions. It includes the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, the Pacific Coast, and Alaska and Hawaii. The West has a variety of climates, from the deserts of the Southwest to the rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.

The West has abundant natural resources, including minerals, timber, and water. These resources have attracted people to the region throughout its history. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought thousands of people to the West in search of gold.

Today, the West has a diverse economy. Technology is important, especially in California's Silicon Valley. Tourism is also significant, with visitors coming to see the region's national parks, beaches, and cities. **Seattle** is a major port city and a center for the aerospace and technology industries.

## Challenges and Opportunities

The United States faces both challenges and opportunities in the 21st century. The country has a strong economy and a powerful military, but it also faces issues such as terrorism and economic inequality.

### The Economy

The United States has the world's largest economy. It is a mixed economy, which means it combines elements of capitalism and government regulation. The country produces a wide variety of goods and services, from agricultural products to advanced technology.

The U.S. economy has experienced both growth and recessions in recent decades. The Great Recession of 2007-2009 was a severe economic downturn that led to high unemployment and a decline in housing prices. The economy gradually recovered, with job growth and rising stock prices.

Economic inequality is a challenge in the United States. There is a significant gap between the wealthiest Americans and those with lower incomes. This inequality affects access to education, healthcare, and other opportunities.

### Terrorism

**Terrorism** is the use of violence against civilians to achieve political goals. The United States has been a target of terrorism, most notably the attacks of September 11, 2001. On that day, terrorists hijacked four airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., and a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people were killed.

After the 9/11 attacks, the United States declared a "War on Terror." The country invaded Afghanistan, where the terrorists had been based, and later Iraq. These wars were costly in terms of lives and money.

Terrorism remains a concern for the United States. The country has implemented security measures to prevent attacks, but the threat of terrorism continues to influence U.S. foreign policy and domestic security.

### International Relations

The United States is a global superpower with significant influence in international affairs. The country has alliances with many nations and is a member of organizations such as the United Nations and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization).

Relations with other countries can be both cooperative and competitive. The United States works with other nations on issues such as trade, security, and environmental protection. However, there are also tensions with countries that have different political systems or interests.

For example, the United States has had a complex relationship with Cuba, which is only about 100 miles away. The United States was opposed to Cuba's communist dictatorship, and Cold War hostilities between the countries led to tense situations. Beginning in 2014, President Obama set policies and made agreements with Cuba, allowing more travel to and trade with Cuba. He also reopened the U.S. Embassy in Cuba's capital, Havana.

### Domestic Politics

The United States has a two-party political system dominated by the Democratic and Republican parties. Elections are held regularly at the federal, state, and local levels. The country has experienced political polarization in recent years, with sharp divisions between the two major parties.

During the 2016 election, Donald Trump, a business leader, was the Republican Party candidate. He defeated the Democratic Party candidate, Hillary Clinton, a former first lady, senator, and secretary of state. As in other recent elections, the economy and terrorism were two issues that concerned voters. Some voters were concerned about expanding trade with other countries and the decline of manufacturing jobs in the United States.

Issues of cultural conflict within the United States also were discussed during the election. These issues included the role racism plays in society and who should be allowed to immigrate to the United States. The candidates and their supporters also differed in how they thought religious values should be reflected in government and laws.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the geographic features, resources, and economic activities found in different regions of the United States. The Northeast is densely populated and a center of finance and education. The South has a warm climate and a diverse economy. The Midwest is an agricultural and manufacturing region. The West is geographically diverse with abundant natural resources.

You also learned that the economy and terrorism are two important issues facing the country today. The United States has a strong economy but faces challenges such as economic inequality. Terrorism remains a concern, influencing both domestic security and foreign policy.
