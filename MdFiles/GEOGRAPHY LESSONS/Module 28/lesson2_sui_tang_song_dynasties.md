## Disorder and Reunification

### The Period of Disunion

After the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 CE, China entered a period of political fragmentation known as the Period of Disunion (220-589 CE). During this time, China was divided into several competing kingdoms, and there was no central authority governing the entire country.

The Period of Disunion was marked by several key developments:

- **Political Instability**: Multiple dynasties rose and fell in different regions of China. The Three Kingdoms period (220-280 CE) was followed by a series of short-lived dynasties in the north and south.

- **Foreign Influence**: Northern China was conquered by various non-Chinese peoples from Central Asia, who established their own dynasties. These rulers gradually adopted Chinese culture and administrative practices.

- **Spread of Buddhism**: Buddhism, which had been introduced to China during the Han dynasty, flourished during this period. Buddhist monasteries became centers of learning and culture, and many Chinese people embraced Buddhist teachings.

- **Cultural Developments**: Despite the political fragmentation, this period saw significant cultural achievements in literature, art, and philosophy. The "Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove," a group of Daoist scholars and poets, lived during this time.

### The Sui Dynasty

In 581 CE, a general named Yang Jian seized power in northern China and proclaimed himself Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty. By 589 CE, he had conquered southern China, reunifying the country after nearly four centuries of division.

The Sui dynasty (581-618 CE) was short-lived but accomplished several important things:

- **Centralized Government**: The Sui emperors reestablished a strong central government based on the Han model. They created a new legal code and reorganized the bureaucracy.

- **Grand Canal**: Emperor Yang, the second Sui ruler, ordered the construction of the Grand Canal, a massive waterway linking northern and southern China. The canal connected the Yellow River and Yangtze River systems, facilitating the transportation of grain and other goods between different regions of China.

- **Military Campaigns**: The Sui conducted military campaigns to secure China's borders and expand its territory. However, a series of costly and unsuccessful campaigns against Korea, combined with the burden of massive construction projects, led to widespread discontent.

The harsh demands placed on the Chinese people by Sui rulers, particularly the forced labor required for the Grand Canal and military campaigns, led to rebellions. In 618 CE, Emperor Yang was assassinated, and the Sui dynasty collapsed.

### The Tang Dynasty

Following the fall of the Sui, one of the rebel leaders, Li Yuan, established the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE). The Tang would rule China for nearly three centuries, presiding over one of the most prosperous and culturally brilliant periods in Chinese history.

Under the Tang, China became the largest, wealthiest, and most powerful nation in the world. The Tang expanded China's borders through military campaigns and diplomatic relations, creating an empire that extended into Central Asia, Korea, and Vietnam.

Key developments during the Tang dynasty included:

- **Expanded Bureaucracy**: The Tang further developed the civil service examination system, allowing talented men from various backgrounds to enter government service based on merit rather than birth.

- **Religious Policies**: Buddhism continued to flourish early in the Tang period. However, in 845 CE, Emperor Wuzong launched a persecution of Buddhism, confiscating monastery lands and forcing monks and nuns to return to secular life. While Buddhism survived this persecution, it never regained its former prominence in China.

- **Foreign Relations**: The Tang maintained diplomatic relations with many countries and welcomed foreign visitors, including merchants, missionaries, and students. The Tang capital, Chang'an (modern Xi'an), became a cosmopolitan city with residents from across Asia.

- **Women's Status**: Women enjoyed relatively high status during the early Tang period. The most notable example was Wu Zetian, who ruled as empress in her own right from 690 to 705 CE—the only woman to officially rule China as emperor in over 2,000 years of history.

The Tang dynasty began to decline in the late 8th century. A major rebellion led by An Lushan in 755-763 CE severely weakened the dynasty, though it survived for another century and a half. By the early 10th century, the Tang had lost control of much of its territory, and in 907 CE, the dynasty officially ended.

### The Song Dynasty

After a brief period of disunion known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907-960 CE), China was reunified under the Song dynasty (960-1279 CE).

The Song never controlled as much territory as the Tang. From the beginning, they faced powerful enemies on their northern border, including the Liao, Western Xia, and Jin states. In 1127, the Jin conquered northern China, forcing the Song court to flee south. The Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279 CE) continued to rule southern China until the Mongol conquest.

Despite these military challenges, the Song period was a time of economic prosperity, cultural achievement, and technological innovation. The Song made up for their military weakness with diplomatic skill, often paying tribute to their northern neighbors to maintain peace.

## Cities and Trade

### Urban Growth

The Tang and Song dynasties saw remarkable urban growth. Chang'an, the Tang capital, was the largest city in the world during the 8th century, with a population of over one million people. The city was laid out in a grid pattern, with wide avenues, markets, temples, and palaces.

During the Song dynasty, urbanization accelerated further. Kaifeng, the Northern Song capital, and later Hangzhou, the Southern Song capital, were bustling metropolises with populations approaching or exceeding one million. These cities featured:

- **Commercial Districts**: Specialized markets selling everything from basic necessities to luxury goods.

- **Entertainment**: Theaters, teahouses, restaurants, and pleasure quarters where people could enjoy performances, socialize, and relax.

- **Religious Institutions**: Buddhist temples, Daoist shrines, and Confucian academies served both spiritual and educational purposes.

- **Public Services**: Urban infrastructure included bridges, canals, firefighting forces, and public toilets.

Song cities were known for their vibrant nightlife. Unlike earlier periods when cities imposed curfews, Song urban centers allowed businesses to operate late into the night, with restaurants, teahouses, and entertainment venues staying open to serve customers.

### Economic Revolution

The Tang and Song periods witnessed what some historians call a "medieval economic revolution" in China, characterized by:

- **Agricultural Improvements**: The introduction of early-ripening rice from Vietnam allowed farmers to grow multiple crops per year. New irrigation techniques and farming tools increased productivity.

- **Population Growth**: Improved agricultural output supported population growth. China's population roughly doubled during the Tang and Song periods, reaching about 100 million by 1100 CE.

- **Commercialization**: The economy became increasingly commercialized, with a growing emphasis on trade and manufacturing. Paper money, first issued by the government during the Song dynasty, facilitated commercial transactions.

- **Technological Innovations**: Advances in technology improved production methods in industries such as textiles, ceramics, and metallurgy.

### Trade Networks

Trade flourished during the Tang and Song dynasties, both within China and with foreign countries:

- **Internal Trade**: The Grand Canal, rivers, and an improved road network facilitated the movement of goods throughout China. Southern agricultural products were shipped north, while northern raw materials moved south.

- **Maritime Trade**: During the Song dynasty, maritime trade expanded dramatically. Chinese ships sailed to Southeast Asia, India, and even the east coast of Africa. Quanzhou, Guangzhou, and other coastal cities became major ports.

- **Foreign Merchants**: Arab, Persian, Jewish, and Southeast Asian merchants established communities in Chinese port cities. These foreign merchants brought exotic goods and new ideas to China.

- **Exports and Imports**: China exported silk, porcelain, tea, and other manufactured goods. In return, it imported spices, ivory, precious stones, and other luxury items.

The prosperity generated by trade contributed to the growth of a wealthy merchant class. Although merchants were traditionally ranked low in the Confucian social hierarchy (below scholars, farmers, and artisans), in practice, wealthy merchants enjoyed considerable influence and a luxurious lifestyle during the Tang and Song periods.

## Art and Inventions

### Literature and Art

The Tang and Song dynasties are considered golden ages of Chinese literature and art:

- **Poetry**: Tang poetry represents the pinnacle of classical Chinese verse. Famous Tang poets include Li Bo (Li Bai), known for his romantic, imaginative style; Du Fu, whose socially conscious poems reflected the suffering of ordinary people; and Wang Wei, who combined poetry with landscape painting.

- **Prose**: Song writers developed a clear, elegant prose style that became a model for later generations. The Song also saw the emergence of new literary forms, including the short story and drama.

- **Painting**: Landscape painting flourished during the Tang and Song periods. Song artists in particular developed sophisticated techniques for depicting mountains, rivers, and mists, creating works that expressed philosophical ideas about humanity's relationship with nature.

- **Ceramics**: Tang potters created colorful glazed figures and vessels. Song ceramics, especially the delicate, translucent porcelain known as celadon, were prized throughout Asia and beyond.

- **Architecture**: Tang and Song architects designed impressive palaces, temples, pagodas, and bridges. Many of these structures influenced architectural styles throughout East Asia.

### Scientific and Technological Innovations

The Tang and Song periods were marked by remarkable scientific and technological achievements:

- **Printing**: Woodblock printing, which had been invented earlier, became widespread during the Tang dynasty. In the 11th century, Bi Sheng invented movable type printing, using clay characters that could be arranged and reused. These printing technologies made books more affordable and accessible, contributing to the spread of literacy and knowledge.

- **Gunpowder**: Originally discovered by Daoist alchemists seeking an elixir of immortality, gunpowder was first used for fireworks and signal flares. By the Song dynasty, the Chinese were using gunpowder in primitive bombs and firearms.

- **Compass**: The magnetic compass was developed for navigation during the Song dynasty. This invention would later revolutionize maritime travel worldwide.

- **Astronomical Instruments**: Song astronomers created sophisticated instruments for observing celestial bodies, including an armillary sphere that modeled the movements of stars and planets.

- **Mechanical Clock**: In 1088, Su Song built a water-powered mechanical clock tower that could track the movements of heavenly bodies and tell time with remarkable accuracy.

- **Other Inventions**: Tang and Song innovators also developed or improved technologies such as the spinning wheel, the pound lock for canals, and the chain drive for machinery.

These inventions not only improved life in China but eventually spread to other parts of the world, contributing to global technological development.

## Confucianism and Government

### Neo-Confucianism

During the Tang and Song dynasties, Confucian thought underwent a revival and transformation. This new interpretation of Confucianism, known as Neo-Confucianism, integrated elements of Buddhism and Daoism while maintaining the core Confucian emphasis on ethics, education, and social order.

Key aspects of Neo-Confucianism included:

- **Metaphysics**: Neo-Confucian thinkers developed philosophical concepts about the nature of reality, the universe, and human nature.

- **Self-Cultivation**: Neo-Confucians emphasized the importance of moral self-improvement through education, reflection, and proper behavior.

- **Social Ethics**: Like earlier Confucians, Neo-Confucians stressed the importance of proper relationships and social harmony.

The most influential Neo-Confucian philosopher was Zhu Xi (1130-1200 CE), who synthesized various strands of Neo-Confucian thought into a coherent system. His commentaries on the Confucian classics became the standard interpretation for centuries.

### The Civil Service Examination System

The civil service examination system, which had begun during the Han dynasty and was further developed under the Tang, reached its mature form during the Song dynasty. This system was designed to select government officials based on merit rather than birth or wealth.

The examination system worked as follows:

- **Preparation**: Candidates spent years studying the Confucian classics and literary composition. Most attended private academies or studied with tutors, though some government schools existed.

- **Local Examinations**: Candidates first took examinations at the county and prefectural levels. Those who passed received the title of "cultivated talent" (xiucai).

- **Provincial Examinations**: Successful candidates from the local level could take the provincial examinations. Those who passed became "recommended men" (juren).

- **Metropolitan Examinations**: The highest level of examinations was held in the capital. Those who passed became "presented scholars" (jinshi) and were eligible for government appointments.

The examinations tested knowledge of the Confucian classics, literary composition, calligraphy, and understanding of government affairs. They were extremely difficult, with pass rates often below 5%. Many candidates took the examinations multiple times throughout their lives, and some never passed despite decades of effort.

### Scholar-Officials

Those who passed the civil service examinations became scholar-officials, forming an elite class that combined intellectual and political authority. These officials served in various capacities, from local magistrates to high ministers at the imperial court.

Scholar-officials were expected to be both moral exemplars and practical administrators. Their duties included maintaining public order, administering justice, collecting taxes, overseeing public works, and implementing government policies.

The jobs performed by scholar-officials were often challenging, but they came with impressive benefits as well. Scholar-officials were granted considerable respect from the Chinese people. They often received reduced penalties for breaking the law. Many also became wealthy from gifts given by people seeking their aid.

The civil service examination system helped ensure that only talented, intelligent people became scholar-officials. The civil service system was a major factor in the stability of the Song government. Scholar-officials remained important in China for centuries.

## Summary

The Tang and Song dynasties were periods of great advancement. After the fall of the Han dynasty, China experienced a period of disunion before being reunified by the Sui dynasty. The Tang dynasty that followed created a powerful empire with a cosmopolitan culture. The Song dynasty, though militarily weaker, presided over economic prosperity and cultural brilliance.

Cities grew dramatically during these periods, becoming centers of commerce, culture, and entertainment. Trade networks expanded both within China and internationally. Tang and Song China produced remarkable achievements in literature, art, science, and technology, including inventions such as printing, gunpowder, and the compass that would eventually transform the world.

The civil service examination system based on Confucian thought shaped Chinese government, creating a meritocratic bureaucracy of scholar-officials. This system provided stability and continuity to Chinese governance for centuries.
