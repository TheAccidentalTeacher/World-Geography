# Lesson 3: The Yuan and Ming Dynasties

## The Big Idea
The Chinese were ruled by foreigners during the Yuan dynasty, but they threw off Mongol rule and prospered during the Ming dynasty.

## Main Ideas
- The Mongol Empire included China, and the Mongols ruled China as the Yuan dynasty.
- The Ming dynasty was a time of stability and prosperity.

## If YOU lived there...
You are a farmer in northern China in 1212. As you pull weeds from a wheat field, you hear a sound like thunder. Looking toward the sound, you see hundreds—no, thousands—of warriors on horses on the horizon, riding straight toward you. You are frozen with fear. Only one thought fills your mind—the Mongols are coming.

**What can you do to save yourself?**

## The Mongol Empire

Among the nomadic peoples who attacked the Chinese were the Mongols. For centuries, the Mongols had lived as tribes in the vast grasslands of Central Asia, north of China. They were skilled horsemen and fierce warriors who followed a nomadic lifestyle, moving with their herds of horses, sheep, and goats in search of pasture.

### Genghis Khan and the Rise of the Mongols

In the early 13th century, a Mongol leader named Temujin united the various Mongol tribes under his rule. In 1206, he took the title Genghis Khan, meaning "Universal Ruler." Under his leadership, the Mongols began a series of military campaigns that would create the largest contiguous land empire in history.

Genghis Khan was a brilliant military strategist who revolutionized warfare. His armies were highly disciplined and mobile, capable of traveling long distances quickly. The Mongols were expert horsemen who could shoot arrows with deadly accuracy while riding at full gallop. They also adopted and improved upon military technologies from the peoples they conquered, including siege weapons for attacking fortified cities.

The Mongols' military tactics often included psychological warfare. They deliberately spread terrifying stories about their cruelty to encourage cities to surrender without resistance. Cities that surrendered peacefully were generally spared, while those that resisted were often destroyed, with many inhabitants killed.

### The Mongol Conquest of China

In 1211, Genghis Khan led his armies into northern China, which was then ruled by the Jin dynasty. The Mongols captured Beijing in 1215, but the complete conquest of China would take decades.

After Genghis Khan's death in 1227, his empire was divided among his sons and grandsons. His grandson Kublai Khan continued the conquest of China, finally defeating the Southern Song dynasty in 1279. With this victory, Kublai Khan became the ruler of all China, establishing the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368).

### The Yuan Dynasty

Kublai Khan moved the Mongol capital to Beijing (which he called Dadu, or "Great Capital") and adopted many Chinese governmental practices. However, he and his successors maintained their Mongol identity and kept the Chinese separate from their Mongol rulers.

The Yuan dynasty implemented a rigid social hierarchy:
1. Mongols at the top
2. Central Asians, Middle Easterners, and Europeans (collectively called "people with colored eyes")
3. Northern Chinese and other conquered peoples
4. Southern Chinese (the former subjects of the Southern Song dynasty)

This system discriminated against the Chinese majority. Chinese were excluded from the highest government positions and faced various restrictions. For example, they were forbidden to learn the Mongol language or marry Mongols.

Despite this discrimination, the Yuan period saw significant cultural and scientific exchange. The Mongol Empire's vast extent—stretching from Korea to Eastern Europe—created a network that facilitated the movement of people, goods, and ideas across Eurasia. Merchants, missionaries, and travelers moved more freely than ever before.

### Marco Polo and the Yuan Court

One famous visitor to Yuan China was Marco Polo, a Venetian merchant who arrived at Kublai Khan's court around 1275 and reportedly served the emperor for 17 years. After returning to Europe, Marco Polo dictated an account of his travels that introduced many Europeans to China and other Asian lands.

Marco Polo described Kublai Khan's capital as a magnificent city with wide streets, beautiful gardens, and a vast palace complex. He marveled at Chinese inventions such as paper money, coal burning, and the imperial postal system. While some scholars question aspects of Marco Polo's account, his book became extremely influential in shaping European perceptions of China.

### The Fall of the Yuan Dynasty

The Yuan dynasty began to decline in the mid-14th century due to a combination of factors:

- **Natural Disasters**: Floods and epidemics, including the Black Death (bubonic plague), caused widespread suffering.

- **Economic Problems**: The government printed too much paper money, leading to inflation. Heavy taxation burdened the Chinese population.

- **Corruption and Factionalism**: The Mongol court was plagued by corruption and power struggles among competing factions.

- **Loss of the Mandate of Heaven**: In Chinese political theory, natural disasters and social unrest were signs that a dynasty had lost the Mandate of Heaven—the divine right to rule. Many Chinese believed the Mongols had lost this mandate.

In the 1350s and 1360s, numerous rebellions broke out across China. The most successful rebel leader was Zhu Yuanzhang, a former Buddhist monk of peasant origin. In 1368, Zhu's forces captured Beijing, forcing the last Yuan emperor to flee to Mongolia. Zhu declared himself emperor, establishing the Ming dynasty.

## The Ming Dynasty

The Ming dynasty (1368-1644) was a period of native Chinese rule that restored Chinese pride and prestige after the humiliation of foreign domination. The dynasty's name, Ming, means "bright" or "brilliant," reflecting the founders' aspirations for a new era of Chinese greatness.

### Ming Government and Society

The first Ming emperor, known as the Hongwu Emperor, was determined to eliminate all Mongol influence and restore traditional Chinese culture and institutions. He implemented several important policies:

- **Centralization of Power**: The Hongwu Emperor concentrated power in his own hands, eliminating the position of prime minister and taking personal control of the government.

- **Revival of Confucianism**: The civil service examination system was restored and expanded, with a renewed emphasis on Confucian learning.

- **Agricultural Development**: The government implemented policies to support agriculture, including tax reductions for farmers and irrigation projects.

- **Military Reorganization**: A large standing army was maintained to prevent any future foreign invasion.

The Ming social structure followed traditional Confucian principles, with scholars at the top, followed by farmers, artisans, and merchants. However, in practice, wealthy merchants often enjoyed considerable influence and a luxurious lifestyle.

### Economic Prosperity

The Ming period was generally one of economic prosperity and population growth. By the late Ming period, China's population had reached about 160-200 million people.

Key aspects of the Ming economy included:

- **Agricultural Production**: Improved farming techniques and the introduction of new crops from the Americas (such as corn, sweet potatoes, and peanuts) increased food production.

- **Manufacturing**: The Ming period saw the production of high-quality goods, including porcelain (often called "china" in English because of its origin), silk, cotton textiles, and lacquerware.

- **Domestic Trade**: Internal trade flourished, with goods moving along China's extensive network of rivers, canals, and roads.

- **Foreign Trade**: Despite official restrictions, foreign trade expanded, particularly in the later Ming period. Chinese goods were in high demand throughout Asia and, increasingly, in Europe.

### The Forbidden City

The third Ming emperor, the Yongle Emperor, moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing. There, he ordered the construction of a vast imperial palace complex known as the Forbidden City.

Completed in 1420, the Forbidden City was the world's largest palace complex, covering 178 acres (72 hectares) and containing nearly 1,000 buildings. Its name came from the fact that ordinary people were forbidden to enter without permission.

The Forbidden City was designed according to traditional Chinese principles:

- **Symmetry and Balance**: The complex was laid out along a north-south axis, with buildings arranged symmetrically.

- **Hierarchy**: The most important buildings, including the emperor's throne halls, were positioned along the central axis.

- **Symbolism**: The architecture incorporated numerous symbolic elements. For example, the roofs were covered with yellow tiles (yellow being the imperial color), and the number of statues and decorative elements often had symbolic significance.

The Forbidden City served as the imperial residence and center of government for nearly 500 years, from the Ming dynasty through the Qing dynasty (1644-1912).

### The Voyages of Zheng He

One of the most remarkable achievements of the early Ming dynasty was a series of naval expeditions led by Admiral Zheng He between 1405 and 1433. Zheng He was a Muslim eunuch who had risen to high position in the Ming court.

Zheng He commanded a fleet of massive ships—some reportedly over 400 feet long, much larger than European vessels of the time. His fleet included over 300 ships and carried nearly 28,000 men on some voyages.

These expeditions visited Southeast Asia, India, the Persian Gulf, and East Africa. Their purposes included:

- **Diplomacy**: Establishing relations with foreign countries and gaining recognition of Ming supremacy.

- **Trade**: Exchanging Chinese silk, porcelain, and other goods for foreign products.

- **Exploration**: Gathering information about distant lands.

Unlike European explorers of a later period, Zheng He did not attempt to conquer or colonize the lands he visited. Instead, he engaged in diplomacy and trade, bringing back exotic items such as giraffes, zebras, and other animals unknown in China.

### The Great Wall

The Ming dynasty is known for rebuilding and extending the Great Wall of China. While earlier dynasties had built walls to protect against northern invaders, much of this construction had been of tamped earth. The Ming rebuilt many sections in brick and stone, creating the impressive structure that tourists visit today.

The Ming Great Wall stretched for over 5,500 miles (8,850 kilometers) from the Yalu River in the east to Jiayuguan in the west. It included watchtowers, garrison stations, and signal towers that could communicate through smoke signals or fire.

Despite its impressive scale, the Great Wall was not entirely effective as a defensive structure. Mongol raiders could still find ways around or through it, and ultimately, the Ming dynasty fell not because the wall was breached, but because a general opened the gates to rebel forces.

### Ming Culture and Arts

The Ming dynasty was a period of cultural flourishing:

- **Literature**: The Ming period saw the development of the vernacular novel, written in everyday language rather than classical Chinese. Famous works include "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," and "Journey to the West."

- **Porcelain**: Ming porcelain, especially the blue-and-white ware decorated with cobalt blue under a clear glaze, became highly prized both in China and abroad.

- **Painting**: Ming painters continued the scholarly tradition of landscape painting. Some artists, such as Shen Zhou and Wen Zhengming, formed the Wu School, known for its elegant, refined style.

- **Furniture**: Ming furniture, characterized by its simple, elegant designs and fine craftsmanship, is still admired and imitated today.

- **Gardens**: The Ming period saw the development of the classical Chinese garden, especially in the city of Suzhou. These gardens combined architecture, water features, rocks, and plants to create miniature idealized landscapes.

### The Decline of the Ming Dynasty

By the late 16th century, the Ming dynasty began to face increasing problems:

- **Political Corruption**: The imperial court was plagued by corruption and factional struggles, particularly involving eunuchs who had gained considerable power.

- **Economic Difficulties**: Government finances were strained by military expenditures, corruption, and declining tax revenues.

- **Natural Disasters**: A series of droughts, floods, and epidemics caused widespread suffering.

- **Peasant Rebellions**: Economic hardship and government corruption led to numerous peasant uprisings.

- **External Threats**: The Manchus, a people from northeast Asia (Manchuria), were becoming increasingly powerful and threatening China's northern borders.

In 1644, a rebel leader captured Beijing, and the last Ming emperor committed suicide. A Ming general invited the Manchus to help defeat the rebels, but once inside the Great Wall, the Manchus conquered China for themselves, establishing the Qing dynasty (1644-1912).

### Isolationism and Its Consequences

One factor that contributed to the Ming dynasty's decline was its policy of isolationism—avoiding contact with other countries. This policy became particularly strict after the voyages of Zheng He.

In the 1430s, a new Ming emperor made Zheng He return to China and dismantle his fleet. At the same time, he banned foreign trade. China entered a period of isolationism. Isolationism is a policy of avoiding contact with other countries.

In the end, this isolationism had great consequences for China. By the late 1800s, the Western world had made huge leaps in technological progress. Westerners were able to take power in some parts of China. Partly due to its isolation and lack of progress, China was too weak to stop them. Gradually, China's glory faded.

## Summary

The Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) was established by the Mongols under Kublai Khan after they completed their conquest of China. The Mongols implemented a social hierarchy that discriminated against the Chinese, but their rule also facilitated cultural and commercial exchange across Eurasia. The Yuan dynasty declined due to natural disasters, economic problems, and Chinese resistance, eventually falling to the Ming dynasty in 1368.

The Ming dynasty (1368-1644) restored native Chinese rule and was generally a period of stability and prosperity. The Ming emperors centralized power, revived Confucianism, and supported economic development. Early Ming achievements included the construction of the Forbidden City and Zheng He's naval expeditions. The Ming also rebuilt the Great Wall and presided over cultural achievements in literature, porcelain, painting, and other arts. However, the dynasty eventually declined due to corruption, economic difficulties, natural disasters, and external threats. The Ming policy of isolationism ultimately weakened China, leaving it vulnerable to Western imperialism in later centuries.
