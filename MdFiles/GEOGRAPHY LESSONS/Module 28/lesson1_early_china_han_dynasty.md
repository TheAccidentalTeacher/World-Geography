# Lesson 1: Early China and the Han Dynasty

## The Big Idea
Early Chinese history was shaped by four dynasties—the Shang, the Zhou, the Qin, and the Han.

## Main Ideas
- Chinese civilization began along two rivers.
- The Zhou and Qin dynasties changed Chinese society and government.
- The Han dynasty was a time of advances in trade, science, and the arts.

## If YOU lived there...
You are the ruler of China, and hundreds of thousands of people look to you for protection. For many years, your country has lived in peace. Large cities have grown up, and traders travel freely from place to place. Now, however, a new threat looms. Invaders from the north are threatening China's borders. Frightened by the ferocity of these invaders, the people turn to you for help.

**What will you do to protect your people?**

## Chinese Civilization Begins

### Geography of China

Chinese civilization began along two major rivers: the Huang He (Yellow River) and the Chang Jiang (Yangtze River). These rivers provided water for drinking and irrigation, fertile soil for farming, and transportation routes for trade and communication.

The geography of China played a crucial role in shaping its civilization:

- **Natural Barriers**: China is surrounded by natural barriers that provided protection but also isolated it from other civilizations. These barriers include:
  - The Himalaya Mountains to the southwest
  - The Gobi Desert to the north
  - The Pacific Ocean to the east

- **Diverse Landscapes**: China's geography includes a variety of landscapes:
  - Fertile river valleys where early agriculture flourished
  - Vast plains suitable for farming
  - Mountainous regions that were more difficult to settle
  - Coastal areas that later facilitated maritime trade

These geographic features helped shape China's development as a distinct civilization with limited outside influence for much of its early history.

### Early Settlements

Archaeological evidence shows that people have lived in China for hundreds of thousands of years. By around 7000 BCE, early Chinese people had begun farming along the Huang He and Chang Jiang rivers. They grew crops such as millet and rice and domesticated animals like pigs, dogs, and chickens.

As agriculture developed, permanent settlements grew. By about 5000 BCE, people in China were living in organized villages. They made pottery using potter's wheels and began to develop more complex societies.

### The Shang Dynasty

The first Chinese dynasty for which we have clear historical evidence is the Shang dynasty, which ruled from around 1600 to 1046 BCE. The Shang established their capital at Anyang and controlled territory in northeastern China.

Key features of the Shang dynasty included:

- **Social Structure**: Shang society was hierarchical, with a king at the top, followed by nobles, craftspeople, farmers, and slaves.

- **Religion**: The Shang practiced ancestor worship, believing that the spirits of deceased ancestors could influence the living. They also worshipped various gods, including Shangdi, a supreme deity.

- **Oracle Bones**: Shang priests would write questions to the gods on animal bones or turtle shells, then apply heat until the bones cracked. The priests would interpret these cracks as answers from the gods. These oracle bones provide some of our earliest examples of Chinese writing.

- **Bronze Technology**: The Shang were skilled bronze workers who created elaborate vessels for religious ceremonies and weapons for warfare.

- **Warfare**: The Shang used horse-drawn chariots in battle, giving them a military advantage over neighboring peoples.

The Shang made significant cultural contributions that would influence Chinese civilization for thousands of years, including the development of a writing system that is the ancestor of modern Chinese characters.

## The Zhou and Qin Dynasties

### The Zhou Dynasty

Around 1046 BCE, the Zhou people overthrew the Shang and established the Zhou dynasty, which would become the longest-lasting dynasty in Chinese history (1046-256 BCE).

The Zhou introduced several important concepts:

- **The Mandate of Heaven**: The Zhou claimed that they had overthrown the Shang because the Shang kings had become corrupt and lost the "Mandate of Heaven" — the divine right to rule. According to this concept, a dynasty ruled with Heaven's approval as long as its kings were just and capable. If a dynasty's rulers became corrupt or failed to protect the people, Heaven would withdraw its mandate, leading to the dynasty's downfall.

- **Feudal System**: The early Zhou kings could not directly control all of their territory, so they established a feudal system. They gave land to loyal nobles, who in turn provided soldiers and tax revenue to the king. Over time, however, these nobles became increasingly independent, weakening central Zhou authority.

During the Zhou period, two important philosophical traditions emerged:

- **Confucianism**: Founded by Confucius (551-479 BCE), this philosophy emphasized proper behavior, respect for elders and superiors, and the importance of education. Confucius believed that if rulers were virtuous and set a good example, their subjects would follow suit.

- **Daoism**: Founded by Laozi, Daoism emphasized living in harmony with the Dao (the Way), the natural order of the universe. Daoists advocated simplicity, naturalness, and non-interference with the course of nature.

The later Zhou period (known as the Warring States Period, 475-221 BCE) was marked by constant warfare among competing states. This period of conflict and instability set the stage for the rise of the Qin dynasty.

### The Qin Dynasty

In 221 BCE, the state of Qin, under the leadership of King Zheng, conquered all rival states and unified China. King Zheng proclaimed himself Shi Huangdi, meaning "First Emperor," and established the Qin dynasty.

Although the Qin dynasty was short-lived (221-206 BCE), it had a profound impact on Chinese history:

- **Centralized Government**: Shi Huangdi abolished the feudal system and established a centralized government with a bureaucracy based on merit rather than birth.

- **Standardization**: To unify the empire, Shi Huangdi standardized weights, measures, currency, and even the writing system. These standards helped facilitate trade and communication throughout China.

- **Infrastructure**: The Qin built an extensive network of roads and canals to improve transportation and communication. They also connected existing walls to create an early version of the Great Wall to protect against northern invaders.

- **Legalism**: The Qin government was based on Legalism, a philosophy that emphasized strict laws with harsh punishments. Legalists believed that people were naturally selfish and could only be controlled through fear of punishment.

Shi Huangdi was a controversial ruler. While his reforms strengthened and unified China, his methods were often brutal. He burned books that contradicted official Qin philosophy, executed scholars who criticized him, and forced massive numbers of laborers to work on projects like the Great Wall and his enormous tomb, which contained thousands of life-sized terracotta soldiers.

The harshness of Qin rule led to widespread discontent. After Shi Huangdi's death in 210 BCE, rebellions broke out across China. By 206 BCE, the Qin dynasty had collapsed, and a new dynasty, the Han, took power.

## The Han Dynasty

The Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) is considered one of China's golden ages. Under Han rule, China expanded its territory, developed its economy, and made advances in many fields.

### Government and Society

The Han dynasty maintained the centralized government established by the Qin but softened many of its harsher aspects:

- **Confucian Bureaucracy**: The Han emperor Wu Di established an imperial university to train government officials in Confucian principles. He also created a civil service examination system to select officials based on merit rather than birth. This system would continue, with modifications, until the early 20th century.

- **Expanded Territory**: The Han expanded China's borders through military campaigns and diplomacy. They pushed into Central Asia, Korea, and Vietnam, spreading Chinese influence and culture.

- **Social Structure**: Han society was hierarchical, with scholars and officials at the top, followed by farmers, artisans, merchants, and at the bottom, slaves.

### Economy and Trade

The Han period saw significant economic development:

- **Agriculture**: Improved farming techniques and tools, including the invention of the iron plow, increased agricultural productivity.

- **Industry**: Iron production flourished, and craftspeople produced high-quality goods such as silk, lacquerware, and bronze items.

- **The Silk Road**: During the Han dynasty, trade routes connecting China to Central Asia, India, and the Roman Empire were established. These routes, collectively known as the Silk Road, facilitated the exchange of goods and ideas between East and West.

Chinese silk was highly prized in Rome, and China grew wealthy from this trade. In return, China imported goods such as glass, gold, silver, and horses from the West.

### Science and Technology

The Han dynasty was a time of remarkable scientific and technological innovation:

- **Paper**: Around 105 CE, a court official named Cai Lun invented a process for making paper from materials such as tree bark, hemp, rags, and fishing nets. This invention would eventually spread worldwide and revolutionize communication and record-keeping.

- **Seismograph**: In 132 CE, a scientist named Zhang Heng invented a device that could detect earthquakes hundreds of miles away. This early seismograph helped alert the government to earthquakes in distant provinces.

- **Astronomy**: Han astronomers made detailed observations of the stars and planets. They recorded comets, sunspots, and other celestial phenomena.

- **Medicine**: Han physicians developed theories about the causes of disease and created treatments using herbs and other natural substances. They practiced acupuncture and understood the concept of taking a pulse to diagnose illness.

### Arts and Literature

The Han dynasty also saw achievements in the arts and literature:

- **Poetry and Literature**: Han writers produced works in various genres, including poetry, history, and philosophy. Sima Qian, the court historian, wrote the "Records of the Grand Historian," a comprehensive history of China up to his time.

- **Music and Dance**: Music was an important part of court life and religious ceremonies. Musicians played instruments such as bells, drums, flutes, and stringed instruments.

- **Visual Arts**: Han artists created beautiful works in jade, bronze, and lacquer. They also produced paintings and sculptures, including detailed ceramic figures buried in tombs.

### The Silk Road

The Silk Road was not a single road but a network of trade routes spanning thousands of miles from China to the Mediterranean Sea. It got its name from the valuable Chinese silk that was traded along these routes.

Traveling the Silk Road was dangerous. Merchants faced natural hazards such as deserts and mountains, as well as the threat of bandits. To minimize risks, caravans loaded with valuable goods, including silks and jade, banded together for protection. Armed guards were hired to protect traders from bandits. Weather presented other dangers, including blizzards and sandstorms.

Still, the Silk Road was worth its many risks. Silk was so popular in Rome, for example, that China grew wealthy from that trade relationship alone. Traders returned from Rome with silver, gold, precious stones, and horses.

But trade goods and money were not the only things exchanged on the Silk Road. Traders on the route exchanged ideas along with trade goods. For example, traders carried the technique of papermaking from China to Southwest Asia and Europe. At the same time, missionaries carried new religions, including Christianity and Buddhism, to China. Buddhism in particular would play a major role in China in later centuries.

## Summary

Early Chinese history was shaped by the Shang, Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties. The Shang established the foundations of Chinese civilization, including a writing system and bronze technology. The Zhou introduced important concepts like the Mandate of Heaven and saw the emergence of Confucianism and Daoism. The Qin unified China and implemented standardization but ruled harshly. The Han dynasty was a golden age of expansion, economic development, and advances in science, technology, and the arts. The establishment of the Silk Road during the Han period connected China to the wider world, facilitating the exchange of goods, technologies, and ideas.
