   - Days 9-11 compressed into single slide #60
   - No Day 12 for final wrap-up
   - Missing 4 full days of content!

3. INCONSISTENT PACING
   - Day variation: 5-8 slides per day
   - Some days too content-heavy, others too light

   - Advanced topics (Ancient Civilizations) get full day
   - Final synthesis/assessment gets 1 slide
