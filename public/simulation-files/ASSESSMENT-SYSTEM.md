## üìù **MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS** (DOK 3-4)

### **Question 1: Geographic Investigation Analysis (DOK 3)**
*A detective team investigating stolen ancient maps has discovered the following evidence:*
- *Theft occurred near major river confluence*
- *Artifacts include Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets with geographic coordinates*
- *Security cameras show suspects using GPS technology*
- *Economic records indicate buyers from countries with developing economies*

*Based on this evidence and your knowledge of geographic concepts, which investigation strategy would be MOST effective?*

A) Focus only on the physical geography of river systems to track escape routes
B) Analyze the economic geography of potential buyer countries while using ancient Mesopotamian geographic knowledge to decode the tablets and modern technology to track suspects
C) Interview witnesses in the local area without considering broader geographic patterns
D) Rely solely on modern GPS tracking without considering cultural or historical context

**Correct Answer: B**  
**DOK Level**: 3 (Strategic Thinking - requires synthesis of multiple geographic concepts)

### **Question 2: Cultural-Geographic Pattern Analysis (DOK 4)**
*Detective teams have noticed that geographic artifacts are being stolen in a specific pattern:*
- *Week 1: Ancient Chinese Silk Road maps (mountainous regions)*
- *Week 2: Mesopotamian river valley tablets (fertile crescent)*
- *Week 3: Indian monsoon pattern scrolls (subcontinental climate)*
- *Week 4: Egyptian Nile navigation papyrus (river civilization)*

*Analyzing this pattern using principles from early civilization geography and modern crime analysis, what does this suggest about the criminal's ultimate goal?*

A) Random theft with no geographic logic
B) The criminal is systematically collecting ancient geographic knowledge of major trade routes and civilization centers to create a comprehensive map of historical global commerce for modern economic advantage
C) The thefts are focused only on river civilizations
D) The criminal is only interested in Asian geographic knowledge

**Correct Answer: B**  
**DOK Level**: 4 (Extended Thinking - requires synthesis across multiple civilizations, analysis of patterns, and projection of criminal motivation)

---

### **Question 3: Human-Environment Interaction Investigation (DOK 3)**
*A stolen government atlas contains maps showing:*
- *Urban population density patterns*
- *Natural resource distribution*
- *Climate change vulnerability zones*
- *Economic development indicators*

*As a geographic detective, you must predict where criminals might use this information. Using your understanding of human-environment interaction and economic geography, which scenario represents the HIGHEST risk for criminal activity?*

A) Using population maps to plan tourist routes
B) Combining vulnerability zone data with resource maps to exploit climate-affected communities for illegal resource extraction while avoiding law enforcement in sparsely populated areas
C) Using climate data only for weather prediction
D) Studying economic indicators for academic research

**Correct Answer: B**  
**DOK Level**: 3 (Strategic Thinking - requires analysis of multiple geographic factors and prediction of criminal behavior)

## ‚úçÔ∏è **WRITING ASSIGNMENTS** (DOK 3-4)

### **Writing Assignment 1: Geographic Detective Case Analysis (DOK 4)**

**Prompt**: 
You are a senior detective presenting your Quarter 1 case findings to the International Geographic Bureau. Write a comprehensive 3-4 paragraph analysis that demonstrates your mastery of geographic concepts from Modules 1-8.

**Requirements**:
- **Paragraph 1**: Analyze how your understanding of physical geography (Module 2) and geographic tools (Module 1) helped solve specific cases. Provide concrete examples of how landforms, climate, or geographic tools provided crucial evidence.

- **Paragraph 2**: Explain how human geography concepts (Module 3), economic patterns (Module 4), and government systems (Module 5) influenced criminal behavior and investigation strategies. Use specific examples from your detective work.

- **Paragraph 3**: Demonstrate how knowledge of early civilizations (Modules 6-8) enhanced your ability to interpret ancient artifacts and understand cultural evidence. Connect ancient geographic knowledge to modern investigation techniques.

- **Paragraph 4**: Synthesize your learning by proposing how geographic knowledge could prevent future crimes. Consider physical, human, economic, political, and cultural geographic factors in your prevention strategy.

**Assessment Rubric**:
- **DOK 4 Mastery**: Synthesizes concepts across all modules, demonstrates deep understanding of geographic connections, proposes innovative solutions
- **DOK 3 Proficient**: Uses multiple geographic concepts effectively, shows good analysis and reasoning
- **DOK 2 Developing**: Uses some geographic concepts with basic analysis
- **DOK 1 Beginning**: Lists geographic facts without analysis or connection

---

### **Writing Assignment 2: Cross-Cultural Geographic Investigation Report (DOK 3)**

**Prompt**: 
Your detective team has been assigned to work with international partners on a case involving stolen artifacts from multiple early civilizations. Write a 2-3 paragraph report analyzing the geographic and cultural challenges of this international investigation.

**Requirements**:
- **Paragraph 1**: Compare and contrast the geographic features of at least three early civilization regions (choose from Modules 6-8: Mesopotamia/Egypt, China, or India). Explain how geographic features influenced each civilization's development and how this knowledge helps in artifact recovery.

- **Paragraph 2**: Analyze the cultural and political challenges of working across different countries and cultures. Use examples from your study of government systems (Module 5) and human geography (Module 3) to explain how cultural differences might affect investigation methods.

- **Paragraph 3**: Propose specific strategies for overcoming these geographic and cultural challenges. Demonstrate how economic cooperation (Module 4) and modern geographic tools (Module 1) could facilitate successful international detective work.

**Assessment Rubric**:
- **DOK 3 Mastery**: Demonstrates sophisticated analysis of geographic and cultural factors, proposes well-reasoned strategies
- **DOK 3 Proficient**: Shows good understanding of geographic concepts with solid analysis
- **DOK 2 Developing**: Basic understanding with limited analysis
- **DOK 1 Beginning**: Simple descriptions without analysis
