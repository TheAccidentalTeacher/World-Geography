# Geographic Detective Academy: Day 1
## Student Handout - Mystery in the Amazon (Part 1)

### CASE #1: MYSTERY IN THE AMAZON

**CONFIDENTIAL: FOR DETECTIVE EYES ONLY**

### Case Briefing: The Missing Explorer

Dr. Isabella Rivera, a renowned explorer and botanist, has gone missing in the Amazon rainforest while researching rare plant species. She was last heard from three days ago when she sent a brief radio message mentioning she had discovered something significant near what she described as "the meeting of waters." She was supposed to return to base camp that evening but never arrived.

Your mission as Geographic Detectives is to analyze the Amazon environment and determine where Dr. Rivera might be located. Time is critical - the rainforest is vast, and conditions can be dangerous.

### Evidence Log

Use this log to record important information about Dr. Rivera's disappearance:

| Evidence Item | Description | Geographic Significance |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Last known location | | |
| Radio message content | | |
| Equipment she carried | | |
| Weather conditions | | |
| Research focus | | |

### Geographic Profile: The Amazon Rainforest

The Amazon rainforest is the world's largest tropical rainforest, covering about 2.7 million square miles across nine countries in South America. It's home to the Amazon River, the second-longest river in the world, with thousands of tributaries creating a complex network of waterways.

**Key Facts:**
- Countries: Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana
- Size: Approximately 2.7 million square miles
- Climate: Hot and humid year-round
- Rainfall: 80-400 inches annually
- Biodiversity: Home to 10% of all known species on Earth

### Physical Geography Investigation

As you investigate the physical geography of the Amazon, record your observations about these key features:

#### 1. River Systems
