# Geographic Detective Academy: Day 2
## Student Handout - Mystery in the Amazon (Part 2)

### CASE #1: MYSTERY IN THE AMAZON (Continued)

**CONFIDENTIAL: FOR DETECTIVE EYES ONLY**

### Day 1 Investigation Recap

Before continuing your investigation, review your key findings from Day 1:
- Dr. Isabella Rivera's last known location: _______________________________
- Her research focus: _______________________________
- Significant clues discovered: _______________________________
- Promising search areas identified: _______________________________

### Climate Factors Investigation

The Amazon rainforest has a unique climate that affects both plant life and human activities. As you investigate how climate might impact Dr. Rivera's situation, record your observations:

#### Rainfall Patterns
The Amazon receives approximately 80-400 inches of rainfall annually, with variations by season and location.

**Current Rainfall Data for Search Area:**
- Recent precipitation: _______________________________
- Seasonal pattern: _______________________________
- Flooding potential: _______________________________

**How might rainfall affect Dr. Rivera's movement and safety?**
_______________________________
_______________________________
_______________________________

#### Temperature and Humidity
The Amazon maintains high temperatures (70-91Â°F) and humidity (80%+) year-round.

**Current Conditions:**
- Temperature range: _______________________________
- Humidity level: _______________________________
- Heat index: _______________________________

**How might these conditions affect someone lost in the rainforest?**
_______________________________

#### Weather-Related Hazards
Circle potential weather hazards in the search area:
- Flash flooding
- Lightning storms
- Mudslides
- River swelling
- Fog/reduced visibility
- Other: _______________________________

### Vegetation Clues

The Amazon rainforest has distinct vegetation layers and plant communities that can provide important clues.

#### Rainforest Layers
Match each layer with its characteristics:

| Layer | Characteristics |
|-------|----------------|
| Forest Floor | |
| Understory | |
| Canopy | |
| Emergent Layer | |

Characteristics to match:
- Receives only 2% of sunlight; decomposing matter; fungi
- Dense layer of trees 60-90 feet tall; most animal life
- Scattered tall trees up to 200 feet; exposed to wind and sun
- Shrubs, small trees, and plants adapted to low light

#### Plant Species Investigation
Dr. Rivera was researching medicinal plants. Based on the evidence, which plant communities should be prioritized in the search?

- [ ] River edge plants
- [ ] Canopy epiphytes
- [ ] Forest floor fungi
- [ ] Emergent layer specimens
- [ ] Other: _______________________________

**Reasoning:**

### Terrain Investigation

The Amazon's terrain varies more than many people realize. Analyzing the landscape can provide crucial clues.

#### Elevation Changes
On your map, identify and mark:
- Areas of higher elevation (hills, ridges)
- Low-lying areas (potential flooding)
- Steep slopes (difficult terrain)

**How might elevation affect Dr. Rivera's choices for shelter or movement?**
_______________________________
_______________________________

#### Land Stability
Based on recent rainfall and soil types, mark areas on your map where:
- Mudslides might occur
- Ground might be too saturated for safe passage
- Stable terrain provides safer movement

#### Natural Landmarks
Identify potential natural landmarks Dr. Rivera might use for navigation:
- Distinctive rock formations
- Unusually large or recognizable trees
- River bends or confluences
- Clearings or gaps in the canopy

### Evidence Analysis: New Findings

Examine the new evidence collected by the search team and record your analysis:

**Evidence Item 1:** Radio frequency data
What does this tell us? _______________________________
Geographic significance: _______________________________

**Evidence Item 2:** Plant sample analysis
What does this tell us? _______________________________
Geographic significance: _______________________________

**Evidence Item 3:** Local indigenous knowledge
What does this tell us? _______________________________
Geographic significance: _______________________________

### Geographic Deduction
