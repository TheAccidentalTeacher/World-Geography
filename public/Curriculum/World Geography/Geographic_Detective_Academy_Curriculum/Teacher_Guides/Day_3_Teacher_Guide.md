### Lesson Plan

#### Scene 1: Case #2 Introduction (15 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Welcome to your second case, detectives! Today we travel from the lush Amazon rainforest to the stark landscape of the Sahara Desert. A valuable trading caravan has gone missing while crossing the desert between two oasis cities. The caravan was carrying important medical supplies and was following a well-established route, but failed to arrive at its destination five days ago. Local authorities have conducted initial searches along the known route without success. As Geographic Detectives, we've been asked to analyze the desert environment to help determine what might have happened and where the caravan might be found."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 24: CASE #2: MYSTERY IN THE SAHARA
2. Distribute Case #2 file folders to each team
3. Have a student read the case briefing aloud
4. Point out the investigation timeline (2 days for this case)

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do you think investigating a desert environment will differ from the rainforest?
- What unique challenges might a caravan face in the Sahara?
- What types of geographic knowledge will be most important in this case?

#### Scene 2: Case Briefing - The Lost Caravan (20 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Let's examine what we know about the missing caravan. It consisted of 12 people and 18 camels carrying medical supplies between the oasis city of Timbuktu and the settlement of Taoudenni, a journey of approximately 750 kilometers that typically takes 15-18 days. The caravan leader, Omar Bashir, is highly experienced and has made this journey more than 30 times over the past decade. The caravan departed Timbuktu 23 days ago and was expected to arrive at Taoudenni 5 days ago. Their last communication came 10 days ago when they sent a messenger back to a checkpoint reporting they were on schedule but concerned about unusual weather conditions ahead."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 25: Case Briefing - The Lost Caravan
2. Display the map showing the planned caravan route
3. Share the "evidence items" from the initial investigation:
   - Copy of the caravan's official route plan
   - Inventory of supplies they were carrying
   - Weather reports from the past month
   - Statement from the last person to see the caravan
   - Photo of the caravan before departure

**Activity:**
Have teams create an "Evidence Log" in their detective notebooks, recording all known information about the missing caravan.

**Discussion Questions:**
- What factors might cause an experienced caravan leader to deviate from a known route?
- How might the caravan's cargo (medical supplies) affect their decisions?
- What initial hypotheses can we form about the caravan's disappearance?

#### Scene 3: Geographic Profile - The Sahara Desert (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "To solve this case, we need to understand the unique geography of the Sahara Desert. The Sahara is the world's largest hot desert, covering about 3.6 million square miles across much of North Africa. Unlike the Amazon with its abundance of water, the Sahara is defined by its extreme aridity, with some areas receiving less than 5 millimeters of rain per year. The landscape includes vast sand seas called ergs, rocky plateaus called hamadas, gravel plains called regs, dry valleys, salt flats, and occasional oases where groundwater reaches the surface."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 26: Geographic Profile - The Sahara Desert
2. Guide students through the Sahara Desert map, pointing out:
   - The extent of the desert across North Africa
   - Major geographic regions within the Sahara
   - Traditional caravan routes and oasis locations
   - Different desert terrain types
3. Distribute geographic profile fact sheets about the Sahara

**Activity:**
In teams, have students create a "Sahara Geographic Profile Summary" that identifies key features of the desert that might impact their search for the missing caravan.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How does the Sahara's geography differ from the Amazon rainforest we studied earlier?
- What geographic features might serve as landmarks for navigation in the desert?
- How has the Sahara's geography influenced human movement and trade routes?

#### Scene 4: Desert Climate - Extreme Conditions (30 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "The Sahara's climate is one of the most extreme on Earth and understanding it is crucial to our investigation. The desert experiences scorching daytime temperatures that can exceed 120°F (49°C), while nighttime temperatures can drop below freezing in winter months. Rainfall is minimal and unpredictable, with some areas experiencing years without significant precipitation. Strong winds can create sandstorms that reduce visibility to zero and reshape the landscape. These extreme conditions create significant challenges for anyone traveling through the region."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 27: Desert Climate - Extreme Conditions
2. Present climate data for the caravan's route:
   - Temperature ranges (day/night and seasonal variations)
   - Precipitation patterns and drought cycles
   - Wind patterns and sandstorm frequency
   - Humidity levels and evaporation rates
3. Demonstrate how climate affects visibility, navigation, and survival in the desert

**Activity:**
Set up four climate analysis stations where teams will:
- Station 1: Analyze temperature data along the caravan route
- Station 2: Examine satellite imagery of recent sandstorm activity
- Station 3: Study water source mapping and calculate distances between water points
- Station 4: Review historical climate patterns and recent anomalies

Have each team rotate through all stations, collecting data to determine how climate factors might have affected the caravan.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How might extreme temperature variations affect caravan travel decisions?
- What climate hazards pose the greatest threat to desert travelers?
- How could unusual weather patterns cause a caravan to become lost?

#### Scene 5: Desert Landforms - Reading the Landscape (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "The Sahara contains diverse landforms shaped by wind, rare water events, and geological processes. Understanding these features is essential for navigation and survival. Experienced caravan leaders like Omar Bashir rely on their ability to 'read' these landforms to maintain their course and find resources. Let's examine the major landforms along the caravan's route and consider how they might relate to our investigation."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 28: Desert Landforms - Reading the Landscape
2. Introduce the main desert landforms:
   - Ergs (sand seas) - vast areas of sand dunes
   - Regs (gravel plains) - flat, stone-covered expanses
   - Hamadas (rocky plateaus) - elevated, flat-topped areas
   - Wadis (dry riverbeds) - channels that fill during rare rains
   - Oases - vegetated areas where groundwater reaches the surface
3. Show images of each landform type and explain their formation
4. Present a landform map of the caravan's route

**Activity:**
Provide teams with landform identification guides and maps to:
1. Create a landform profile of the caravan's planned route
2. Identify potential hazard zones where navigation would be most challenging
3. Mark areas where the landscape might have changed due to recent weather
4. Determine which landforms might provide shelter during extreme weather

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do desert landforms serve as navigation aids for experienced travelers?
- Which landforms might pose the greatest challenges to the caravan?
- How might recent weather events have altered the landscape along the route?

#### Scene 6: Navigation Challenges - Finding Your Way (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Navigation in the Sahara presents unique challenges. Without prominent landmarks in many areas, travelers have traditionally relied on celestial navigation, knowledge of subtle terrain features, and an understanding of prevailing winds. Modern caravans like Omar's typically use a combination of traditional methods and modern tools like GPS. However, equipment can fail, and environmental conditions can make navigation extremely difficult."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 29: Navigation Challenges - Finding Your Way
2. Explain traditional and modern desert navigation techniques:
   - Celestial navigation using stars and sun
   - Reading dune patterns and wind-created features
   - Following established routes marked by subtle signs
   - Using natural and human-made landmarks
   - Modern GPS and communication systems
3. Present information about navigation challenges specific to the caravan's route

**Activity:**
Have teams engage in a desert navigation exercise:
1. Provide each team with a "navigation scenario" describing conditions the caravan might have faced
2. Ask them to plot alternative routes on their maps based on these scenarios
3. Calculate travel times and resource needs for these alternative routes
4. Identify potential navigation errors that could explain the caravan's disappearance

**Discussion Questions:**
- What navigation methods would be most reliable in different desert conditions?
- How might navigation challenges cause even experienced travelers to become lost?
- What evidence of navigation decisions might we find in the desert landscape?

#### Scene 7: Water Resources - Desert Lifelines (20 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Water is the most precious resource in the desert and access to it determines everything about travel routes and survival. Traditional caravan routes developed specifically to connect water sources. Let's examine the water resources along the caravan's planned route and consider how water availability might have influenced their journey."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 30: Water Resources - Desert Lifelines
2. Present information about water sources in the search area:
   - Known wells and oases on the planned route
   - Seasonal water sources that might be active
   - Underground water indicators in the landscape
   - Water quality variations across the region
3. Share the caravan's water carrying capacity and estimated needs

**Activity:**
Have teams analyze water resource maps to:
1. Calculate the maximum distance the caravan could travel without finding water
2. Identify all potential water sources within a three-day detour of the planned route
3. Determine areas where water sources might have been affected by recent conditions
4. Create a "water resource profile" of the region

**Discussion Questions:**
- How would water considerations affect the caravan's route planning and decisions?
- What might cause a caravan to deviate from their planned route regarding water?
- How might we use knowledge of water resources to narrow our search area?
