### Lesson Plan

#### Scene 1: Case #5 Introduction (15 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Welcome to your fifth case, Geographic Detectives! Today we journey from the flowing waters of the Amazon River to the bustling streets of a major metropolis. Over the past five years, the city of Urbanopolis has been experiencing rapid growth and development. Recently, community members have noticed that green spaces - parks, community gardens, and natural areas - have been mysteriously disappearing across the city. The mayor's office has received numerous complaints but claims all development is following approved plans. As Geographic Detectives, we've been asked to investigate what's happening to these vanishing green spaces and who might be responsible."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 61: CASE #5: MYSTERY IN THE METROPOLIS
2. Distribute Case #5 file folders to each team
3. Have a student read the case briefing aloud
4. Point out the investigation timeline (2 days for this case)

**Discussion Questions:**
- How will investigating an urban environment differ from our previous cases in natural settings?
- Why might green spaces be important in a city environment?
- What types of geographic knowledge will be most useful in this investigation?

#### Scene 2: Case Briefing - The Vanishing Green Spaces (20 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Let's examine what we know about the vanishing green spaces. Urbanopolis is a growing city with a population of approximately 2 million people. Over the past five years, the city has experienced a 15% population increase and significant economic growth. During this same period, satellite imagery shows that the total area of green spaces has decreased by nearly 30%. Community groups have documented at least 12 specific sites where parks, community gardens, or natural areas have been reduced in size or completely eliminated. In each case, the land has been converted to commercial or residential development. What's particularly mysterious is that the city's official urban plan actually calls for a 20% increase in green spaces during this growth period."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 62: Case Briefing - The Vanishing Green Spaces
2. Display the city map showing:
   - Locations of affected green spaces
   - New development projects
   - Population density patterns
   - City districts and neighborhoods
3. Share the "evidence items" from the initial investigation:
   - Before and after satellite images of affected areas
   - Official city development plan excerpts
   - Community complaints and documentation
   - Timeline of green space losses
   - News articles about city growth and development

**Activity:**
Have teams create an "Evidence Log" in their detective notebooks, recording all known information about the vanishing green spaces.

**Discussion Questions:**
- What patterns do you notice in where green spaces are disappearing?
- What potential explanations might account for the discrepancy between the official plan and reality?
- Who might benefit from the conversion of green spaces to development?

#### Scene 3: Geographic Profile - Urban Landscapes (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "To solve this case, we need to understand urban landscapes and how cities are organized. Cities are complex geographic systems with distinctive patterns of land use, transportation networks, population distribution, and economic activity. These patterns aren't random - they reflect historical development, planning decisions, economic forces, and social factors. By analyzing the urban landscape of Urbanopolis, we can better understand the context of our mystery."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 63: Geographic Profile - Urban Landscapes
2. Guide students through the urban geography of Urbanopolis, pointing out:
   - The central business district and commercial zones
   - Residential neighborhoods of varying density
   - Industrial areas and their location patterns
   - Transportation networks and hubs
   - Green spaces and their distribution
   - Historical development patterns from city center outward
3. Distribute urban geography fact sheets

**Activity:**
In teams, have students create an "Urban Landscape Profile" that identifies key features of the city that might impact their investigation of the vanishing green spaces.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How is this city organized geographically, and why?
- What factors influence where different activities and land uses are located?
- How might the city's geographic organization relate to our mystery of vanishing green spaces?

#### Scene 4: Urban Planning - Designing City Spaces (30 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Urban planning is the process of designing and organizing urban spaces to create functional, sustainable, and livable cities. Planners make decisions about land use, transportation, housing, public facilities, and environmental protection. Understanding urban planning helps us see how cities are supposed to develop according to official plans - and how reality sometimes differs from those plans."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 64: Urban Planning - Designing City Spaces
2. Explain key urban planning concepts:
   - Comprehensive planning and zoning
   - Mixed-use development
   - Smart growth and sustainable development
   - Transportation-oriented development
   - Green infrastructure and open space planning
3. Present Urbanopolis's official development plan and its provisions for green spaces

**Activity:**
Set up four urban planning stations where teams will:
- Station 1: Analyze zoning maps and land use regulations
- Station 2: Examine transportation planning and its relationship to development
- Station 3: Study housing development patterns and density
- Station 4: Explore green space planning and environmental considerations

Have each team rotate through all stations, collecting information on how urban planning should guide the development of the city and protection of green spaces.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do urban planners balance different needs and interests in a growing city?
- What mechanisms exist to protect green spaces in urban development plans?
- What might cause a disconnect between official plans and actual development?

#### Scene 5: Urban Patterns - How Cities Grow (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Cities are dynamic systems that grow and change over time. Understanding urban growth patterns helps us analyze how and why cities develop in certain ways. Urbanopolis has experienced several distinct phases of development, from its historic core to its newest suburbs and edge cities. By examining these patterns, we can better understand the forces shaping the city and potentially threatening its green spaces."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 65: Urban Patterns - How Cities Grow
2. Present information about urban growth patterns:
   - Historical development from city center outward
   - Concentric zone, sector, and multiple nuclei models
   - Suburbanization and urban sprawl
   - Gentrification and urban renewal
   - Edge city development
3. Show historical maps and satellite imagery of Urbanopolis's growth over time

**Activity:**
Have teams conduct an "Urban Growth Analysis":
1. Create a timeline of the city's development using historical maps
2. Identify different growth patterns in different parts of the city
3. Map how green spaces have changed during each phase of development
4. Analyze current growth trends and their potential impact on remaining green spaces

**Discussion Questions:**
- What factors have influenced how this city has grown over time?
- How has the relationship between development and green spaces changed through different growth phases?
- What current growth patterns might explain the recent loss of green spaces?

#### Scene 6: Green Spaces - Urban Oases (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Green spaces serve vital functions in urban environments. They provide recreational opportunities, improve air quality, reduce urban heat island effects, manage stormwater, support biodiversity, and contribute to community well-being. Different types of urban green spaces - from formal parks to community gardens to natural areas - serve different purposes and face different pressures in a growing city."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 66: Green Spaces - Urban Oases
2. Explain the types and functions of urban green spaces:
   - City parks and their historical development
   - Community gardens and their social benefits
   - Natural areas and ecological corridors
   - Pocket parks and small urban green spaces
   - Green infrastructure for environmental services
3. Present data on the benefits of green spaces in Urbanopolis
4. Show the inventory of affected green spaces in the case

**Activity:**
Have teams create a "Green Space Inventory and Analysis":
1. Categorize the affected green spaces by type, size, and function
2. Map their distribution across different neighborhoods
3. Analyze demographic data for areas that have lost green spaces
4. Identify patterns in which types of green spaces are most affected

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why are green spaces important in urban environments?
- Which communities seem most affected by the loss of green spaces?
- What patterns do you notice in which types of green spaces are disappearing?

#### Scene 7: Transportation Networks - City Connections (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Transportation networks are the circulatory system of cities, connecting different areas and influencing development patterns. Roads, public transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian paths shape how people move through urban space and often determine where and how development occurs. Understanding Urbanopolis's transportation system may provide important clues about the forces driving development and the loss of green spaces."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 67: Transportation Networks - City Connections
2. Present information about the city's transportation system:
   - Major road networks and highways
   - Public transit lines and stations
   - Recent and planned transportation projects
   - Relationship between transportation and land values
   - Transportation equity across neighborhoods
3. Show maps highlighting the relationship between transportation infrastructure and development

**Activity:**
Have teams conduct a "Transportation Impact Analysis":
1. Map the relationship between transportation corridors and vanishing green spaces
2. Identify recent or planned transportation projects near affected areas
3. Analyze how transportation improvements might affect land values
4. Examine how transportation access differs across neighborhoods

**Discussion Questions:**
- How does transportation infrastructure influence urban development patterns?
- What relationship do you see between transportation projects and the loss of green spaces?
- How might transportation planning be used to either protect or threaten green spaces?
