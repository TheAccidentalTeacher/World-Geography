### Lesson Plan

#### Scene 1: Case #1 Introduction (15 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Good morning, detectives! Today we begin our first official investigation. A renowned explorer, Dr. Isabella Rivera, has gone missing in the Amazon rainforest while researching rare plant species. She was last heard from three days ago when she sent a brief radio message mentioning she had discovered something significant. The local authorities have asked for our help as Geographic Detectives to analyze the environment and determine where she might be. Time is critical - the rainforest is vast, and conditions can be dangerous."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 12: CASE #1: MYSTERY IN THE AMAZON
2. Distribute Case #1 file folders to each team
3. Have a student read the case briefing aloud
4. Point out the investigation timeline (2 days for this case)

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why might geographic knowledge be important in finding a missing person?
- What challenges might someone face in the Amazon rainforest?
- What types of information would be most useful in this investigation?

#### Scene 2: Case Briefing - The Missing Explorer (20 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Let's examine what we know about Dr. Rivera's disappearance. According to her research team, she ventured into this section of the rainforest three days ago. She was studying medicinal plants and was particularly interested in species that grow near river systems. Her last radio message mentioned finding an unusual plant formation near what she described as 'the meeting of waters.' She was supposed to return to base camp that evening but never arrived. Her research assistant reports that she took minimal supplies, expecting a day trip only."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 13: Case Briefing - The Missing Explorer
2. Display the map showing Dr. Rivera's last known location
3. Share the "evidence items" from her research team:
   - Copy of her research permit with study area marked
   - Photo of her equipment (showing what she had with her)
   - Transcript of her last radio message
   - Weather report from the day she disappeared

**Activity:**
Have teams create an "Evidence Log" in their detective notebooks, recording all known information about Dr. Rivera's disappearance.

**Discussion Questions:**
- What is the most important piece of information we have so far?
- What additional information would be helpful for our investigation?
- Based on initial evidence, what factors might have contributed to her disappearance?

#### Scene 3: Geographic Profile - The Amazon Rainforest (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "To solve this case, we need to understand the environment where Dr. Rivera disappeared. The Amazon rainforest is the world's largest tropical rainforest, covering about 2.7 million square miles across nine countries in South America. It's home to the Amazon River, the second-longest river in the world, with thousands of tributaries creating a complex network of waterways. The rainforest has distinct layers - from the forest floor to the emergent layer above the canopy - each with unique plant and animal life."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 14: Geographic Profile - The Amazon Rainforest
2. Guide students through the Amazon rainforest map, pointing out:
   - The extent of the rainforest across South America
   - Major river systems and tributaries
   - Elevation changes and terrain features
   - Different vegetation zones
3. Distribute physical geography fact sheets about the Amazon

**Activity:**
In teams, have students create a "Geographic Profile Summary" that identifies key features of the Amazon that might impact their search for Dr. Rivera.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How might the river systems help us narrow down where Dr. Rivera might be?
- What physical geography features would be most important to consider in our search?
- How might the rainforest environment affect someone who is lost?

#### Scene 4: Physical Geography Clues (30 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "As Geographic Detectives, we need to understand how physical geography can provide clues to solve our mystery. The Amazon has several distinctive physical features that will be important in our investigation. Let's examine these features and consider how they might help us locate Dr. Rivera."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 15: Physical Geography Clues
2. Introduce the key physical geography concepts:
   - River systems and drainage patterns
   - Terrain and elevation changes
   - Soil types and their relationship to vegetation
   - Microclimate variations within the rainforest
3. Set up four evidence stations around the room, each focusing on one aspect of physical geography

**Activity:**
Rotate teams through the evidence stations, having them collect information at each:
- Station 1: River Systems - Maps of the Amazon river network with flow directions and depths
- Station 2: Terrain - Topographic maps and 3D models of the search area
- Station 3: Vegetation - Photos and descriptions of plant communities in different parts of the rainforest
- Station 4: Soil and Geology - Soil maps and information about land stability

**Discussion Questions:**
- Which physical features might help someone navigate through the rainforest?
- How might river patterns give us clues about Dr. Rivera's possible location?
- What physical barriers might prevent someone from returning to their base camp?

#### Scene 5: Following the Rivers - Key to the Mystery (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Dr. Rivera's last message mentioned 'the meeting of waters.' In the Amazon, this could refer to places where rivers join together, often creating distinctive features. These confluence points are significant because they create unique ecosystems and have historically been important navigation landmarks. Let's examine the river systems in our search area to identify possible locations where Dr. Rivera might have been when she sent her message."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 16: Following the Rivers - Key to the Mystery
2. Display the detailed river map of the search area
3. Point out several major confluence points
4. Explain how river color, width, and flow patterns can be distinctive
5. Share satellite images showing actual "meeting of waters" phenomena in the Amazon

**Activity:**
Using string or yarn on large maps, have teams:
1. Trace possible routes Dr. Rivera might have taken from her last known location
2. Identify all major confluence points within a day's journey
3. Calculate approximate distances using the map scale
4. Mark areas that match the description from her last message

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why would a researcher be particularly interested in areas where rivers meet?
- How can we use our knowledge of river systems to narrow down the search area?
- What additional river-related information would help our investigation?

#### Scene 6: Evidence Collection - First Findings (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "We've received some additional evidence from the local search team. They've found what might be signs of Dr. Rivera's presence near one of the tributary junctions. Let's examine these clues and see if they help us narrow down our search area."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 20: Evidence Collection - Piecing Together the Puzzle
2. Distribute "Evidence Packet 1" to each team, containing:
   - Photos of broken branches and what appears to be a temporary rest site
   - A sample page from what might be Dr. Rivera's field notes (partially damaged by water)
   - GPS coordinates of where these items were found
   - A fabric swatch matching Dr. Rivera's research vest

**Activity:**
Have teams analyze the evidence using their Geographic Detective skills:
1. Plot the GPS coordinates on their maps
2. Examine the field notes for clues about direction or intentions
3. Use the physical evidence to make inferences about Dr. Rivera's movements
4. Record their findings and initial theories in their detective notebooks

**Discussion Questions:**
- What does this evidence tell us about Dr. Rivera's possible route?
- How does this evidence relate to the physical geography we've studied?
- What additional search areas should be prioritized based on these findings?

#### Scene 7: Day 1 Wrap-Up and Preparation for Day 2 (10 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Excellent work today, detectives! We've made important progress in understanding the Amazon environment and have begun analyzing the evidence related to Dr. Rivera's disappearance. Tomorrow, we'll continue our investigation by examining climate factors, vegetation patterns, and additional evidence that might help us locate her.
