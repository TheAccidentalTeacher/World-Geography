### Lesson Plan

#### Scene 1: Day 10 Introduction and Review (10 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Welcome back, Geographic Detectives! Yesterday, we began our investigation into the vanishing green spaces of Urbanopolis. We explored urban landscapes, planning processes, growth patterns, the importance of green spaces, and transportation networks. Today, we'll examine the economic forces shaping urban development, collect additional evidence, and work toward solving the mystery of why green spaces are disappearing despite the city's official commitment to expanding them."

**Actions:**
1. Have teams quickly review their Day 9 findings
2. Display the city map showing affected green spaces and development patterns
3. Outline today's investigation plan

**Discussion Questions:**
- What were the most significant discoveries from yesterday's investigation?
- Which patterns in the disappearance of green spaces seem most important?
- What additional information do we need to identify who is responsible?

#### Scene 2: Urban Economics - Following the Money (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "To understand urban development decisions, we often need to 'follow the money.' Economic factors like land values, development potential, tax revenues, and investment returns strongly influence how urban land is used. Even when cities have plans to preserve green spaces, economic pressures can sometimes lead to different outcomes. Let's examine the economic forces at work in Urbanopolis to see how they might relate to our mystery."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 68: Urban Economics - Following the Money
2. Present information about urban economic factors:
   - Land value patterns across the city
   - Property tax structures and incentives
   - Development costs and returns on investment
   - Public vs. private financing of urban amenities
   - Economic benefits of green spaces vs. development
3. Share economic data for areas where green spaces have disappeared

**Activity:**
Set up four urban economics stations where teams will:
- Station 1: Analyze property value maps before and after green space conversion
- Station 2: Examine development project financial documents
- Station 3: Study tax revenue projections for different land uses
- Station 4: Explore cost-benefit analyses of green space preservation vs. development

Have each team rotate through all stations, collecting information on how economic factors might be driving the conversion of green spaces.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do economic factors influence decisions about urban land use?
- Who benefits financially from the conversion of green spaces to development?
- What economic arguments could be made for preserving green spaces?

#### Scene 3: Evidence Collection - Urban Clues (30 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "We've received important new evidence from community activists who have been monitoring development activities! They've collected documents, photographs, and other information that might help us understand what's happening to the city's green spaces. Let's analyze these urban clues to see if they reveal patterns or connections we haven't noticed before."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 69: Evidence Collection - Urban Clues
2. Distribute "Evidence Packet 1" to each team, containing:
   - Meeting minutes from city planning commission meetings
   - Permit applications for developments replacing green spaces
   - Campaign contribution records for city officials

   - Emails between developers and city officials (obtained through public records requests)

**Activity:**
Have teams analyze the evidence using their Geographic Detective skills:
1. Create a timeline of decisions and approvals related to green space conversion
2. Identify key decision-makers involved in multiple projects
3. Map connections between developers, officials, and specific projects
4. Look for patterns in how green space protections were circumvented
5. Record their findings and initial theories in their detective notebooks

**Discussion Questions:**
- What patterns do you notice in how green spaces are being converted to development?
- Who appears to be involved in making these decisions?
- What processes or loopholes might be allowing these changes despite the official plan?

#### Scene 4: Geographic Deduction - Connecting the Dots (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Now it's time to apply our geographic detective skills to connect the dots in this urban mystery. By combining our understanding of urban landscapes, planning processes, economic factors, and the evidence we've collected, we can make informed deductions about what's happening to Urbanopolis's green spaces and who is responsible."

**Actions:**

2. Guide students through the deductive reasoning process:
   - Reviewing all geographic factors and evidence
   - Identifying spatial and temporal patterns
   - Connecting economic incentives to development decisions
   - Drawing logical conclusions based on comprehensive analysis
3. Provide a "Geographic Deduction Worksheet" to structure their analysis

**Activity:**
Have teams work through their analysis:
1. Create a concept map showing relationships between key players and decisions
2. Identify the common factors in green space conversions
3. Analyze the economic and political forces driving these changes
4. Determine who benefits most from the current pattern of development
5. Complete their Geographic Deduction Worksheet

**Discussion Questions:**

- Based on all evidence, what do you think is happening to the green spaces?

#### Scene 6: Case Solved - Development Scheme Exposed (20 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Based on your geographic detective work and the additional evidence, the mystery has been solved! As many of you deduced, the disappearance of green spaces is the result of a coordinated scheme between Metropolis Development Corporation and several city officials. They've been using a series of administrative loopholes to redesignate green spaces for development without going through proper public processes. The corporation has been acquiring properties adjacent to green spaces, then applying for 'minor boundary adjustments' that gradually reduce the protected areas. Meanwhile, the officials involved have been receiving campaign contributions and other benefits from the corporation."
