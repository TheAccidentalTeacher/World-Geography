### Lesson Plan

#### Scene 1: Case #6 Introduction (15 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Welcome to your sixth case, Geographic Detectives! Today we enter the fascinating realm of political geography as we investigate a Jurisdictional Crisis. Two neighboring regions, Westland and Eastland, are engaged in a heated dispute over territory that both claim as their own. The disputed area includes valuable resources and important cultural sites. Recently, tensions have escalated as both sides have increased their presence in the region. The United Nations has asked our Geographic Detective Academy to analyze the situation from a neutral perspective and help identify possible resolutions based on geographic evidence and principles."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 73: CASE #6: JURISDICTIONAL CRISIS
2. Distribute Case #6 file folders to each team
3. Have a student read the case briefing aloud
4. Point out the investigation timeline (2 days for this case)

**Discussion Questions:**
- How will investigating a political geography case differ from our previous investigations?
- Why might boundary disputes be particularly challenging to resolve?
- What types of geographic knowledge will be most useful in this investigation?

#### Scene 2: Political Geography Investigation (20 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Political geography examines how humans have divided and organized space through political boundaries, territories, and governance systems. It explores the relationship between geography and political power, including how boundaries are created, contested, and changed over time. To solve our jurisdictional crisis, we'll need to understand the fundamental concepts of political geography and apply them to the specific dispute between Westland and Eastland."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 74: Political Geography Investigation
2. Introduce key political geography concepts:
   - Territory and sovereignty
   - Boundaries and borders
   - Nation-states and other political units
   - Geopolitics and international relations
   - Territorial disputes and resolution mechanisms
3. Present the map of Westland, Eastland, and the disputed territory
4. Provide historical context for the two regions and their relationship

**Activity:**
Have teams create a "Political Geography Profile" in their detective notebooks:
1. Identify the key political entities involved in the dispute
2. Map the claimed boundaries of each entity
3. Note the geographic features of the disputed territory
4. List the potential factors contributing to the conflict

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do political boundaries relate to physical geography?
- What factors might make some boundaries more stable than others?
- Why do territorial disputes often persist for long periods?

#### Scene 3: International Boundaries - Types and Characteristics (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Boundaries between political entities come in many forms. Some follow natural features like rivers or mountain ranges, while others are geometric lines drawn on maps. Some boundaries developed gradually over centuries, while others were imposed by outside powers. Understanding the different types of boundaries and their characteristics helps us analyze why some boundaries are stable and accepted, while others become sources of conflict."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 75: International Boundaries - Types and Characteristics
2. Explain the major boundary types:
   - Natural (physiographic) boundaries: rivers, mountains, etc.
   - Geometric boundaries: straight lines, parallels, meridians
   - Cultural boundaries: language, religion, ethnicity
   - Historical boundaries: based on past political control
   - Superimposed boundaries: imposed by outside powers
3. Discuss boundary characteristics:
   - Antecedent: boundary established before current settlement
   - Subsequent: boundary established after settlement
   - Relict: boundary no longer functions but leaves landscape impact
   - Superimposed: boundary imposed despite existing cultural patterns

**Activity:**
Set up four boundary analysis stations where teams will:
- Station 1: Analyze natural boundaries and their advantages/disadvantages
- Station 2: Examine geometric boundaries and their historical context
- Station 3: Study cultural boundaries and identity issues
- Station 4: Explore superimposed boundaries and resulting conflicts

Have each team rotate through all stations, collecting information on how different boundary types relate to the Westland-Eastland dispute.

**Discussion Questions:**
- What type of boundary exists between Westland and Eastland?
- How might the boundary type contribute to the current dispute?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of different boundary types?

#### Scene 4: Maritime Boundaries - Ocean Territory Investigation (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "The dispute between Westland and Eastland includes not just land territory but also maritime areas. Maritime boundaries define territorial waters, exclusive economic zones, and other ocean territories claimed by coastal states. These boundaries are governed by international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Understanding maritime boundary principles is crucial for resolving the coastal aspects of our jurisdictional crisis."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 76: Maritime Boundaries - Ocean Territory Investigation
2. Explain maritime boundary concepts:
   - Territorial sea (12 nautical miles)
   - Contiguous zone (24 nautical miles)
   - Exclusive Economic Zone (200 nautical miles)
   - Continental shelf rights
   - International waters
3. Present maps showing the maritime claims of Westland and Eastland
4. Discuss how islands, bays, and coastal geography affect maritime boundaries

**Activity:**
Have teams conduct a "Maritime Boundary Analysis":
1. Map the maritime claims of both Westland and Eastland
2. Identify areas of overlapping claims
3. Apply UNCLOS principles to determine legitimate maritime boundaries
4. Analyze how offshore resources might influence the dispute

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do maritime boundary principles differ from land boundary principles?
- What geographic features complicate maritime boundary delimitation?
- How might access to maritime resources affect the overall territorial dispute?

#### Scene 5: Disputed Territories - Conflict Investigation (30 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Disputed territories exist around the world, ranging from small contested areas to large regions claimed by multiple countries. These disputes arise from historical claims, unclear boundaries, resource competition, strategic interests, and cultural connections. By examining the specific characteristics of the Westland-Eastland disputed territory, we can better understand the nature of the conflict and potential paths to resolution."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 77: Disputed Territories - Conflict Investigation
2. Present detailed information about the disputed territory:
   - Physical geography and natural resources
   - Population distribution and demographics
   - Historical control and governance
   - Economic activities and development
   - Cultural and religious significance
3. Share statements from both Westland and Eastland about their claims
4. Provide historical maps showing how control of the region has changed over time

**Activity:**
Have teams create a "Disputed Territory Analysis":
1. Map the physical and human geography of the disputed area
2. Create a timeline of historical control and key events
3. Identify the specific claims and evidence presented by each side
4. Analyze the strategic importance of the territory to each party

**Discussion Questions:**
- What factors make this territory valuable to both Westland and Eastland?
- How do historical claims and current control complicate the dispute?
- What geographic evidence supports or challenges each side's claims?

#### Scene 6: Government Geography - Political Organization Investigation (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "To fully understand the jurisdictional crisis, we need to examine the political organization of both Westland and Eastland. How governments organize and administer territory affects their approach to boundary disputes. Different political systems, administrative structures, and governance traditions can create challenges when trying to resolve territorial conflicts."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 78: Government Geography - Political Organization Investigation

   - Administrative divisions and local governance
   - Center-periphery relations
   - Minority group representation and rights
   - Territorial management approaches
4. Discuss how these differences affect the boundary dispute

**Activity:**
Have teams conduct a "Governance Comparison":
1. Create profiles of the political systems of Westland and Eastland
2. Identify how each government's structure influences its approach to the dispute
3. Analyze how local communities in the disputed area are governed
4. Determine how governance differences might complicate resolution efforts

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do the different political systems of Westland and Eastland affect the dispute?
- What governance challenges exist in the disputed territory?
- How might political organization influence potential resolution approaches?

#### Scene 7: Electoral Geography - Voting Pattern Investigation (20 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Electoral geography examines the spatial aspects of voting and political representation. In territorial disputes, understanding voting patterns and political preferences can reveal important insights about local perspectives and national politics. The political dynamics within Westland and Eastland influence how their governments approach the boundary dispute and what solutions they might accept."

**Actions:**
