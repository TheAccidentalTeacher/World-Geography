1. Show Slide 58: Geographic Deduction - Tracking Upstream
2. Guide students through the deductive reasoning process:
   - Reviewing all geographic factors and evidence
   - Applying the concept that "everything flows downstream"
   - Identifying patterns in water quality data
   - Drawing logical conclusions based on watershed analysis
3. Provide a "Geographic Deduction Worksheet" to structure their analysis

**Activity:**
Have teams work through their analysis:
1. Eliminate unlikely pollution sources based on location, timing, or type
2. Identify the watershed area where the pollution most likely originates
3. List all human activities in that area that could cause the observed changes
4. Rank these potential sources based on all available evidence
5. Complete their Geographic Deduction Worksheet
