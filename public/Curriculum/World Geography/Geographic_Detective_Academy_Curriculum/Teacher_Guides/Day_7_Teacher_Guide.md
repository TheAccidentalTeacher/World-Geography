### Lesson Plan

#### Scene 1: Welcome to Part 2 of the Geographic Detective Academy (15 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Congratulations, Geographic Detectives! You've successfully completed the first three cases of our academy. You've investigated mysteries in the Amazon Rainforest, the Sahara Desert, and the Himalayan Mountains, applying your geographic knowledge to solve complex problems. Today, we begin Part 2 of our curriculum, where we'll tackle four new cases that will challenge you to use more advanced geographic skills and concepts. In this second part, we'll focus more on how human activities interact with natural environments, creating both challenges and opportunities."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 48: Geographic Detective Academy Curriculum: Part 2
2. Review accomplishments from Part 1 (Cases 1-3)
3. Preview the cases for Part 2 (Cases 4-7)
4. Distribute "Geographic Detective Advanced Skills" handouts

**Discussion Questions:**
- What were your favorite aspects of our first three cases?
- Which geographic detective skills have you improved the most so far?
- What are you most looking forward to in Part 2 of our academy?

#### Scene 2: Case #4 Introduction (15 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Our fourth case takes us back to the Amazon region, but with a new focus. While our first case explored the rainforest environment, this time we'll investigate the Amazon River itself - the world's largest river by volume. Communities along a tributary of the Amazon have reported a mysterious change in the water. The river has developed an unusual color and odor, fish populations are declining, and people downstream are experiencing health problems. Local authorities are puzzled by the sudden change and have asked for our help as Geographic Detectives to investigate the cause of this river mystery."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 49: CASE #4: MYSTERY OF THE AMAZON RIVER
2. Distribute Case #4 file folders to each team
3. Have a student read the case briefing aloud
4. Point out the investigation timeline (2 days for this case)

**Discussion Questions:**
- How is this Amazon case different from our first investigation in the rainforest?
- Why might river pollution be particularly challenging to investigate?
- What types of geographic knowledge will be most useful in this investigation?

#### Scene 3: Case Briefing - The Mysterious River Change (20 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Let's examine what we know about the mysterious changes in the river. Over the past month, residents of Porto Verde, a small community along the Rio Negro tributary, have noticed their normally dark-colored river developing an unusual greenish tint and unpleasant smell. Fish catches have declined by nearly 70%, and several children have developed skin rashes after swimming in the water. The changes seem to have appeared suddenly, with no obvious local cause. The affected area extends about 30 kilometers downstream from a point where two smaller rivers join to form this tributary."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 50: Case Briefing - The Mysterious River Change
2. Display the map showing:
   - The affected river section
   - Surrounding communities
   - Upstream areas and tributaries
   - Land use patterns in the watershed
3. Share the "evidence items" from the initial investigation:
   - Water quality reports showing abnormal readings
   - Photos of the discolored water
   - Testimonials from affected community members
   - Timeline of when changes were first noticed
   - Regional development projects map

**Activity:**
Have teams create an "Evidence Log" in their detective notebooks, recording all known information about the river changes.

**Discussion Questions:**
- What patterns do you notice in how and where the river changes are occurring?
- What potential causes might explain these changes?
- How might the river's geography help us track the source of the problem?

#### Scene 4: Geographic Profile - The Amazon River Basin (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "To solve this case, we need to understand the Amazon River system. The Amazon Basin is the largest drainage basin in the world, covering about 40% of South America. The main stem of the Amazon River is about 4,000 miles long, but it's fed by over 1,100 tributaries, creating a vast network that drains water from the Andes Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean. This complex system includes different types of rivers - 'white water' rivers that carry sediment from the Andes, 'clear water' rivers with sandy bottoms, and 'black water' rivers like the Rio Negro that are darkly colored from decaying plant matter."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 51: Geographic Profile - The Amazon River Basin
2. Guide students through the Amazon River Basin map, pointing out:
   - The main stem of the Amazon and major tributaries
   - The watershed boundaries
   - Elevation changes from headwaters to mouth
   - Different river types and their characteristics
   - Human settlements and activities along the rivers
3. Distribute Amazon River Basin fact sheets

**Activity:**
In teams, have students create an "Amazon River System Profile" that identifies key features of the river system that might impact their investigation of the water quality changes.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How does the Amazon River system differ from rivers in our local area?
- Why is understanding the entire watershed important for investigating river pollution?
- How might the different types of rivers (white, clear, black) respond differently to pollution?

#### Scene 5: River System Dynamics - From Mountains to Ocean (30 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Rivers are dynamic systems that shape landscapes and connect distant environments. Understanding how rivers work - how they flow, transport materials, and change over time - is essential for our investigation. The Amazon River system begins high in the Andes Mountains and travels thousands of miles to the Atlantic Ocean, changing dramatically along the way."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 52: River System Dynamics - From Mountains to Ocean
2. Explain key river system concepts:
   - The river continuum from headwaters to mouth
   - Erosion, transportation, and deposition processes
   - River channel patterns (straight, meandering, braided)
   - Floodplain development and seasonal flooding
   - How tributaries contribute to the main stem
3. Demonstrate river dynamics using a stream table or visual model

**Activity:**
Set up four river dynamics stations where teams will:
- Station 1: Analyze river gradient profiles and flow velocity
- Station 2: Examine sediment transport and deposition patterns
- Station 3: Study tributary systems and their influence on the main river
- Station 4: Investigate seasonal variations in river flow and flooding

Have each team rotate through all stations, collecting information on how river dynamics might relate to the spread of pollution.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do upstream activities affect downstream conditions in a river system?
- What river features might concentrate or disperse pollutants?
- How might seasonal changes in river flow affect water quality problems?

#### Scene 6: Water Quality - Reading the River's Health (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Water quality refers to the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water. In healthy river systems, these characteristics support diverse aquatic life and provide safe water for human use. By analyzing water quality parameters, we can identify pollution sources and understand their impacts. Let's examine how we can 'read' the health of a river through water quality indicators."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 53: Water Quality - Reading the River's Health
2. Introduce key water quality parameters:
   - Physical parameters: temperature, turbidity, color, odor
   - Chemical parameters: pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, contaminants
   - Biological parameters: presence of indicator species, algae levels
3. Demonstrate simple water quality testing methods
4. Present water quality data from different points along the affected river

**Activity:**
Have teams analyze water quality data to:
1. Create a "Water Quality Profile" showing how parameters change along the river
2. Identify patterns that might indicate the type and source of pollution
3. Compare current readings with historical baseline data
4. Develop hypotheses about what might be causing the water quality changes

**Discussion Questions:**
- What water quality parameters show the most significant changes?
- How do these changes relate to the symptoms reported by local communities?
- What types of activities or events could cause these specific water quality changes?

#### Scene 7: Watersheds - Everything Flows Downstream (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "A watershed is the entire land area that drains into a particular river or lake. Understanding watersheds is crucial for our investigation because anything that happens within a watershed can potentially affect the water quality downstream. The concept that 'everything flows downstream' is fundamental to solving river pollution mysteries."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 54: Watersheds - Everything Flows Downstream
2. Explain watershed concepts:
   - Watershed boundaries and how they're determined
   - How land use within a watershed affects water quality
   - Point source vs. non-point source pollution
   - How pollutants move through a watershed
3. Present a detailed watershed map of the affected river area
4. Highlight land use patterns and human activities in the watershed

**Activity:**
Have teams conduct a "Watershed Analysis":
1. Identify all potential pollution sources within the watershed
2. Categorize these sources as point source or non-point source
3. Map how pollutants would flow from each source to the affected area
4. Prioritize the most likely sources based on the water quality data

**Discussion Questions:**
- How does the concept of a watershed help us track pollution sources?
- What land use activities in this watershed might contribute to water quality problems?
- How might seasonal factors like rainfall affect how pollutants move through a watershed?

#### Scene 8: Human Impacts - Changing River Systems (20 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Human activities can dramatically alter river systems and their water quality. Development projects, agriculture, mining, and urban growth all leave their mark on rivers. In the Amazon Basin, rapid development is creating new pressures on river ecosystems that have sustained communities for centuries. Understanding these human impacts is essential for identifying the cause of our mystery."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 55: Human Impacts - Changing River Systems
2. Present information about human activities in the region:
   - Recent development projects upstream
   - Agricultural expansion and practices
   - Mining operations in the watershed
   - Urban growth and waste management
   - Dam construction and river modifications
3. Show before-and-after satellite images of land use changes in the watershed

**Activity:**
Have teams create a "Human Impact Assessment":
1. Map the location and timing of major development activities
2. Analyze how each activity might affect water quality
3. Compare the timeline of development with the onset of water quality changes
4. Identify the most likely human activities contributing to the river changes

**Discussion Questions:**
- Which human activities pose the greatest threats to river health?
- How can development needs be balanced with environmental protection?
- What geographic factors make some river systems more vulnerable to human impacts?
