### Lesson Plan

#### Scene 1: Case #3 Introduction (15 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Welcome to your third case, Geographic Detectives! Today we journey from the scorching Sahara Desert to the towering peaks of the Himalayan Mountains. A sacred artifact of great cultural and spiritual significance has disappeared from an ancient monastery in a remote mountain village. The artifact, a ceremonial statue that has been part of the monastery for over 500 years, vanished three days ago. Local authorities are baffled as the monastery is difficult to access and the statue is too heavy for one person to carry easily. As Geographic Detectives, we've been asked to use our understanding of mountain geography and cultural practices to help solve this mystery."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 36: CASE #3: MYSTERY IN THE HIMALAYAS
2. Distribute Case #3 file folders to each team
3. Have a student read the case briefing aloud
4. Point out the investigation timeline (2 days for this case)

**Discussion Questions:**
- How will investigating a mountain environment differ from our previous cases in the rainforest and desert?
- What unique challenges might we encounter in the Himalayas?
- How might cultural geography be especially important in this case?

#### Scene 2: Case Briefing - The Sacred Artifact (20 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Let's examine what we know about the missing artifact. The item is a ceremonial statue called the 'Guardian of the Pass,' made of solid bronze and adorned with turquoise and coral. It stands about 18 inches tall and weighs approximately 40 pounds. The statue has been kept in the main prayer hall of the Namgyal Monastery for over five centuries and is believed to protect travelers crossing the nearby mountain pass. Three days ago, monks discovered it was missing during morning prayers. There were no signs of forced entry, and the monastery guestbook shows only three visitors in the past week - a scholar from a university, a trekking guide, and a merchant from a neighboring valley."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 37: Case Briefing - The Sacred Artifact
2. Display images of:
   - A similar ceremonial statue (representing the missing artifact)
   - The monastery and its mountain setting
   - The prayer hall where the statue was kept
   - The difficult mountain path leading to the monastery
3. Share the "evidence items" from the initial investigation:
   - Monastery guestbook entries
   - Statement from the head monk
   - Map of the monastery grounds
   - Local weather report from the past week
   - Photo of the empty display where the statue stood

**Activity:**
Have teams create an "Evidence Log" in their detective notebooks, recording all known information about the missing artifact.

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why would someone take a heavy statue from a remote monastery?
- What geographic factors might make this theft particularly challenging?
- What cultural significance might this artifact have beyond its material value?

#### Scene 3: Geographic Profile - The Himalayan Mountains (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "To solve this case, we need to understand the unique geography of the Himalayan Mountains. The Himalayas are the world's highest mountain range, stretching about 1,500 miles across five countries: India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and China. They formed when the Indian tectonic plate collided with the Eurasian plate and continue to grow taller by about 5 millimeters per year. This massive mountain system creates a geographic barrier that influences climate, vegetation, animal life, and human settlement patterns across South Asia."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 38: Geographic Profile - The Himalayan Mountains
2. Guide students through the Himalayan region map, pointing out:
   - The extent of the mountain range across countries
   - Major peaks including Mount Everest
   - River systems that originate in the mountains
   - Mountain passes and traditional trade routes
   - Settlement patterns and cultural regions
3. Distribute geographic profile fact sheets about the Himalayas

**Activity:**
In teams, have students create a "Himalayan Geographic Profile Summary" that identifies key features of the mountain region that might impact their investigation of the missing artifact.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How have the Himalayas shaped the cultures and histories of surrounding regions?
- What geographic challenges would someone face when traveling through this region?
- How might mountain geography affect the transportation of a heavy artifact?

#### Scene 4: Mountain Formation - The Birth of Giants (30 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "Understanding how mountains form helps us appreciate the unique landscape of the Himalayas. These mountains were created through a process called orogenesis - specifically when the Indian continental plate collided with the Eurasian plate about 50 million years ago. This ongoing collision continues to push the mountains higher and shapes everything from local weather patterns to where people can build settlements."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 39: Mountain Formation - The Birth of Giants
2. Demonstrate mountain formation using visual aids:
   - Tectonic plate models showing continental collision
   - Cross-section diagrams of the Himalayan range
   - Time-lapse animations of mountain building processes
   - Maps showing how the Indian plate continues to move northward
3. Explain key mountain formation concepts:
   - Plate tectonics and continental collision
   - Folding and faulting of rock layers
   - Uplift and erosion processes
   - Resulting landforms (peaks, valleys, passes)

**Activity:**
Set up a mountain formation demonstration where teams:
1. Use clay or foam layers to model the collision of tectonic plates
2. Observe how the "crust" folds and rises to form mountains
3. Identify different mountain features created by the process
4. Relate the demonstration to specific features in the Himalayan range

**Discussion Questions:**
- How does the ongoing formation of the Himalayas affect the landscape today?
- What hazards might mountain communities face due to these active geological processes?
- How might understanding mountain formation help us in our investigation?

#### Scene 5: Vertical Climate Zones - Climbing Through Ecosystems (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "One of the most fascinating aspects of mountain geography is how climate and ecosystems change as you gain elevation. While it might take thousands of miles of horizontal travel to experience different climate zones, in mountains like the Himalayas, you can pass through multiple ecosystems in just a few miles of vertical climbing. This concept of vertical climate zones is crucial for understanding settlement patterns, agriculture, and travel routes in mountain regions."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 40: Vertical Climate Zones - Climbing Through Ecosystems
2. Present a visual model of vertical climate zones in the Himalayas:
   - Tropical zone (below 3,000 feet)
   - Subtropical zone (3,000-6,000 feet)
   - Temperate zone (6,000-12,000 feet)
   - Alpine zone (12,000-15,000 feet)
   - Arctic/snow zone (above 15,000 feet)
3. Explain how these zones affect:
   - Vegetation and wildlife
   - Agricultural practices
   - Human settlement patterns
   - Travel and transportation options

**Activity:**
Have teams create a "Vertical Climate Profile" for the region around the monastery:
1. Determine the elevation of the monastery (provided in case materials)
2. Identify which climate zone it falls within
3. Map the different zones someone would pass through when traveling to/from the monastery
4. Analyze how these zones might affect the transportation of the stolen artifact

**Discussion Questions:**
- How do vertical climate zones affect daily life in mountain communities?
- What challenges would someone face when moving between different elevation zones?
- How might seasonal changes affect these vertical climate patterns?

#### Scene 6: Cultural Geography - Mountain Traditions (25 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "The physical geography of the Himalayas has profoundly shaped the cultures that developed there. Mountain communities have adapted to their environment through distinctive architectural styles, agricultural practices, religious beliefs, and social structures. Understanding these cultural adaptations is essential for our investigation, as they influence everything from local knowledge of mountain paths to community responses to the theft."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 41: Cultural Geography - Mountain Traditions
2. Introduce key aspects of Himalayan cultural geography:
   - Religious practices and monastery traditions
   - Sustainable agriculture on mountain terraces
   - Traditional building techniques adapted to the terrain
   - Trade networks and cultural exchanges through mountain passes
   - Seasonal migration patterns and resource use
3. Share images and information about the specific cultural region where the monastery is located

**Activity:**
Set up four cultural geography stations where teams will:
- Station 1: Examine traditional Himalayan architecture and settlement patterns
- Station 2: Learn about religious practices and the role of monasteries
- Station 3: Study traditional livelihoods and resource management
- Station 4: Explore trade routes and cultural exchanges between mountain communities

Have each team rotate through all stations, collecting information on how cultural practices might relate to the missing artifact.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How have Himalayan cultures adapted to the challenges of mountain environments?
- What role do sacred objects like the missing statue play in mountain communities?
- How might cultural knowledge help us understand who might have taken the artifact and why?

#### Scene 7: Sacred Geography - Spiritual Landscapes (20 minutes)

**Teacher Script:**
> "In many Himalayan cultures, the landscape itself is considered sacred. Mountains, lakes, caves, and other natural features are often associated with deities or spiritual powers. This concept of sacred geography influences where religious sites are built, how people interact with the environment, and which routes are considered auspicious for travel. The missing artifact, the 'Guardian of the Pass,' is directly connected to this tradition of sacred geography."

**Actions:**
1. Show Slide 42: Sacred Geography - Spiritual Landscapes
2. Explain concepts of sacred geography in the Himalayas:
   - Sacred mountains as the abodes of deities
   - Pilgrimage routes and their significance
   - Monastery placement in relation to landscape features
   - Ritual practices associated with geographic features
3. Show the relationship between the monastery, the nearby mountain pass, and the missing artifact

**Activity:**
Have teams analyze a "Sacred Geography Map" of the region:
1. Identify sacred sites and their relationship to physical features
2. Trace traditional pilgrimage routes
3. Note the timing of religious festivals in relation to seasons
4. Consider how sacred geography might relate to the artifact's disappearance

**Discussion Questions:**
- How does the concept of sacred geography influence movement through the landscape?
- Why might the "Guardian of the Pass" statue be particularly important to local communities?
- How might understanding sacred geography help us determine who took the artifact and why?
