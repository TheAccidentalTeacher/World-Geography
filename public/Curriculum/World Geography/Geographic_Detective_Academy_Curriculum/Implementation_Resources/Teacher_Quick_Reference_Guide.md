### Daily Routine Framework

**1. Case Briefing (10-15 minutes)**
- Review previous day's findings (except Day 1)
- Introduce new evidence or case elements
- Set investigation goals for the day

**2. Investigation Activities (30-40 minutes)**
- Evidence station rotations
- Map analysis
- Document examination
- Team collaboration time

**3. Geographic Skill Development (20-30 minutes)**
- Direct instruction on specific geographic concepts
- Skill practice with detective tools
- Application of concepts to the case

**4. Team Analysis Time (15-20 minutes)**
- Teams discuss findings
- Record observations in detective notebooks
- Develop or refine hypotheses

**5. Case Conference (10-15 minutes)**
- Teams share key discoveries
- Teacher guides discussion toward geographic concepts
- Preview next day's investigation focus

### Classroom Management Tips

**Detective Teams**
- Form balanced teams of 4-5 students
- Assign roles based on strengths but rotate periodically
- Use team names related to geography (Explorers, Navigators, etc.)
- Create team scoring system for positive reinforcement

**Evidence Stations**
- Set up 3-4 stations around the room
- Clear instructions at each station
- Timer for rotations (7-10 minutes per station)
- Evidence collection worksheets for accountability

**Materials Management**
- Assign toolkit monitors in each team
- Create checklist for daily setup and cleanup
- Store case materials in separate, labeled containers
- Use plastic sheet protectors for reusable materials

**Maintaining Engagement**
- Use detective language consistently ("evidence" not "worksheets")
- Dramatic reveals of new case developments
- Occasional "urgent updates" to create excitement
- Recognition system for detective achievements

### Differentiation Strategies

**For Students Needing Additional Support**
- Provide simplified maps with fewer details
- Create evidence analysis guides with prompting questions
- Pair with peer mentors within teams
- Offer pre-teaching of key vocabulary
- Provide visual reference sheets for geographic concepts

**For Advanced Students**
- Assign "specialist" roles requiring deeper research
- Provide additional evidence that adds complexity
- Challenge with advanced map interpretation tasks
- Encourage connections to other subject areas
- Offer leadership opportunities within teams

### Assessment Strategies

**Formative Assessment**
- Detective notebook checks (use sticky notes for feedback)
- Team discussion observations (use checklist)
- Exit tickets with case-related questions
- Quick geographic skill demonstrations
- Self-assessment using detective skill trackers

**Summative Assessment**
- Case solution accuracy
- Final case reports
- Map creation projects
- Evidence analysis demonstrations
- Geographic concept applications

### Troubleshooting Common Challenges

**Challenge: Teams working at different paces**
- Solution: Have extension activities ready for quick finishers
- Example: "Advanced Detective Challenges" related to the case

**Challenge: Difficulty connecting evidence to geographic concepts**
- Solution: Create concept-evidence connection charts
- Example: "How does this river pattern help solve our mystery?"

**Challenge: Unequal participation within teams**
- Solution: Structured role assignments with specific responsibilities
- Example: Each detective must contribute at least three pieces of evidence

**Challenge: Maintaining case continuity across days**
- Solution: Start each day with case recap and evidence wall review
- Example: "Previously in our investigation..." summaries

**Challenge: Balancing fun and learning**
- Solution: Explicit connections between detective activities and learning objectives
- Example: "We're using compass directions to narrow our search area, which helps us understand how coordinates work on maps"

### Key Vocabulary by Case

**Setup Day**
- Geographic detective, evidence, investigation, deduction, observation

**Mystery in the Amazon**
- Rainforest, tributary, confluence, canopy, biodiversity, terrain

**Mystery in the Sahara**
- Desert, arid, oasis, dune, erosion, adaptation, navigation

**Mystery in the Himalayas**
- Elevation, mountain pass, cultural diffusion, sacred site, vertical zonation

**Mystery of the Amazon River**
- Watershed, water quality, sediment, upstream, downstream, pollution

**Mystery in the Metropolis**
- Urban, suburban, infrastructure, zoning, transportation network, green space

**Jurisdictional Crisis**
- Border, territory, sovereignty, international waters, treaty, dispute

### Quick Transitions Between Activities

- "Detectives, secure your evidence and prepare to move to the next investigation station."
- "In 30 seconds, all detective teams should be gathered at the case board."
- "Freeze, detectives! New information has just arrived that requires your attention."
- "Detective teams, prepare to report your findings in 3, 2, 1..."
- "Time to consult with headquarters. Please return to your team stations."

### Parent Engagement Ideas

- Send home "Case of the Day" summaries
- Create a classroom detective blog with investigation updates
- Host a "Detective Showcase" where students present cases
- Send home family geography activities related to current case
- Invite parents with relevant expertise as guest speakers

### Extension Activities

- Create travel brochures for mystery locations
- Design "Geographic Detective" board games
- Develop new mysteries based on local geography
- Connect with classrooms in mystery locations via video chat
- Create digital story maps of solved cases

### End-of-Program Celebration Ideas

- Detective Academy "Graduation" ceremony
- Award certificates for different detective skills
- Create a museum showcase of solved cases
- Host a geographic mystery party
- Produce a detective academy yearbook with case highlights

### Emergency Lesson Adaptations

If you need to adjust due to time constraints or other factors:

**If you have only 30 minutes:**
- Focus on the core case evidence and geographic concept
- Use quick pair discussions instead of full team rotations
- Assign reflection questions as homework

**If technology is unavailable:**
- Use printed maps instead of digital resources
- Create hand-drawn visual aids
- Utilize physical manipulatives for demonstrations

**If you need a substitute teacher:**
- Provide geographic skill practice activities
- Set up review stations for previous case elements
- Have students create case summaries or mind maps
