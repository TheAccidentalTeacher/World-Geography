# Railway Deployment Trigger

This file is created to force Railway redeploy after critical AI lesson planner fixes.

## Changes Made:
- Added missing lesson-calendar-map.json with sample lesson data
- Fixed /api/modules endpoint to use lesson map fallback
- Created proper lesson structure for Module 1 & 2 with complete data

## Railway Environment Variables Required:
- OPENAI_API_KEY (should be set in Railway dashboard)
- MONGODB_URI (optional, has fallback)

Timestamp: $(date)
